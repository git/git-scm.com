  <h1 id="sfc">Git and Software Freedom Conservancy</h1>

  <p>Git is a member project of <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software
  Freedom Conservancy</a>.  Conservancy is a not-for-profit organization that
  provides financial and administrative assistance to open source projects.

  <h2 class="section-start">Donation</h2>

  <p>Conservancy accepts donations on git's behalf. In the past, project money has
  typically gone to defraying travel costs for developers to come to our annual
  <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitTogether">GitTogether</a>
  mini-conference.  A portion of the money goes to Conservancy to cover their
  operating expenses. You can also donate <a
  href="https://sfconservancy.org/donate">directly</a> to Software
  Freedom Conservancy's general fund.
