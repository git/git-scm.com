      <p>There are several options for installing Git on macOS. Note that
  any non-source distributions are provided by third parties, and may

  <h3>Binary installer</h3>
  <p>Tim Harper provided an installer for Git until version 2.33.0 / 2021.
  These installers are no longer linked from here because there are no updates
  since that version, nor are there plans to provide any.</p>

  <h3>Installing git-gui</h3>
  <p>If you would like to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui/">git-gui</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk/">gitk</a>,
