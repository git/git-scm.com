<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git will sometimes need credentials from the user in order to perform
operations; for example, it may need to ask for a username and password
in order to access a remote repository over HTTP. Some remotes accept
a personal access token or OAuth access token as a password. This
manual describes the mechanisms Git uses to request these credentials,
as well as some features to avoid inputting these credentials repeatedly.</p>

<h2 id="_requesting_credentials"><a class="anchor" href="#_requesting_credentials"></a>REQUESTING CREDENTIALS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without any credential helpers defined, Git will try the following
strategies to ask the user for usernames and passwords:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If the <code>GIT_ASKPASS</code> environment variable is set, the program
specified by the variable is invoked. A suitable prompt is provided
to the program on the command line, and the user&#8217;s input is read
from its standard output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, if the <code>core.askPass</code> configuration variable is set, its
value is used as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, if the <code>SSH_ASKPASS</code> environment variable is set, its
value is used as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the user is prompted on the terminal.</p>

<h2 id="_avoiding_repetition"><a class="anchor" href="#_avoiding_repetition"></a>AVOIDING REPETITION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be cumbersome to input the same credentials over and over.  Git
provides two methods to reduce this annoyance:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Static configuration of usernames for a given authentication context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credential helpers to cache or store passwords, or to interact with
a system password wallet or keychain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first is simple and appropriate if you do not have secure storage available
for a password. It is generally configured by adding this to your config:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[credential "https://example.com"]
	username = me</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Credential helpers, on the other hand, are external programs from which Git can
request both usernames and passwords; they typically interface with secure
storage provided by the OS or other programs. Alternatively, a
credential-generating helper might generate credentials for certain servers via
some API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use a helper, you must first select one to use. Git currently
includes the following helpers:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-cache"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-cache"></a>cache </dt>
<dd>
<p>Cache credentials in memory for a short period of time. See
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-credential-cache" >}}'>git-credential-cache[1]</a> for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-store"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-store"></a>store </dt>
<dd>
<p>Store credentials indefinitely on disk. See
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-credential-store" >}}'>git-credential-store[1]</a> for details.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may also have third-party helpers installed; search for
<code>credential-*</code> in the output of <code>git help -a</code>, and consult the
documentation of individual helpers.  Once you have selected a helper,
you can tell Git to use it by putting its name into the
credential.helper variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">

<h3 id="_available_helpers"><a class="anchor" href="#_available_helpers"></a>Available helpers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The community maintains a comprehensive list of Git credential helpers at
<a href="https://git-scm.com/doc/credential-helpers" class="bare">https://git-scm.com/doc/credential-helpers</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_oauth"><a class="anchor" href="#_oauth"></a>OAuth</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative to inputting passwords or personal access tokens is to use an
OAuth credential helper. Initial authentication opens a browser window to the
host. Subsequent authentication happens in the background. Many popular Git
hosts support OAuth.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_credential_contexts"><a class="anchor" href="#_credential_contexts"></a>CREDENTIAL CONTEXTS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git considers each credential to have a context defined by a URL. This context
is used to look up context-specific configuration, and is passed to any
helpers, which may use it as an index into secure storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, imagine we are accessing <code>https://example.com/foo.git</code>. When Git
looks into a config file to see if a section matches this context, it will
consider the two a match if the context is a more-specific subset of the
pattern in the config file. For example, if you have this in your config file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[credential "https://example.com"]
	username = foo</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then we will match: both protocols are the same, both hosts are the same, and
the "pattern" URL does not care about the path component at all. However, this
context would not match:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[credential "https://kernel.org"]
	username = foo</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>because the hostnames differ. Nor would it match <code>foo.example.com</code>; Git
compares hostnames exactly, without considering whether two hosts are part of
the same domain. Likewise, a config entry for <code>http://example.com</code> would not
match: Git compares the protocols exactly.  However, you may use wildcards in
the domain name and other pattern matching techniques as with the <code>http.&lt;URL&gt;.*</code>
options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the "pattern" URL does include a path component, then this too must match
exactly: the context <code>https://example.com/bar/baz.git</code> will match a config
entry for <code>https://example.com/bar/baz.git</code> (in addition to matching the config
entry for <code>https://example.com</code>) but will not match a config entry for
<code>https://example.com/bar</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_configuration_options"><a class="anchor" href="#_configuration_options"></a>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Options for a credential context can be configured either in
<code>credential.*</code> (which applies to all credentials), or
<code>credential.&lt;URL&gt;.*</code>, where &lt;URL&gt; matches the context as described
above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following options are available in either location:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-helper"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-helper"></a>helper </dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of an external credential helper, and any associated options.
If the helper name is not an absolute path, then the string <code>git
credential-</code> is prepended. The resulting string is executed by the
shell (so, for example, setting this to <code>foo --option=bar</code> will execute
<code>git credential-foo --option=bar</code> via the shell. See the manual of
specific helpers for examples of their use.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are multiple instances of the <code>credential.helper</code> configuration
variable, each helper will be tried in turn, and may provide a username,
password, or nothing. Once Git has acquired both a username and a
non-expired password, no more helpers will be tried.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <code>credential.helper</code> is configured to the empty string, this resets
the helper list to empty (so you may override a helper set by a
lower-priority config file by configuring the empty-string helper,
followed by whatever set of helpers you would like).</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-username"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-username"></a>username </dt>
<dd>
<p>A default username, if one is not provided in the URL.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-useHttpPath"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-useHttpPath"></a>useHttpPath </dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, Git does not consider the "path" component of an http URL
to be worth matching via external helpers. This means that a credential
stored for <code>https://example.com/foo.git</code> will also be used for
<code>https://example.com/bar.git</code>. If you do want to distinguish these
cases, set this option to <code>true</code>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_custom_helpers"><a class="anchor" href="#_custom_helpers"></a>CUSTOM HELPERS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can write your own custom helpers to interface with any system in
which you keep credentials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Credential helpers are programs executed by Git to fetch or save
credentials from and to long-term storage (where "long-term" is simply
longer than a single Git process; e.g., credentials may be stored
in-memory for a few minutes, or indefinitely on disk).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each helper is specified by a single string in the configuration
variable <code>credential.helper</code> (and others, see <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a>).
The string is transformed by Git into a command to be executed using
these rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If the helper string begins with "!", it is considered a shell
snippet, and everything after the "!" becomes the command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, if the helper string begins with an absolute path, the
verbatim helper string becomes the command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the string "git credential-" is prepended to the helper
string, and the result becomes the command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The resulting command then has an "operation" argument appended to it
(see below for details), and the result is executed by the shell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some example specifications:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre># run "git credential-foo"
[credential]
	helper = foo

# same as above, but pass an argument to the helper
[credential]
	helper = "foo --bar=baz"

# the arguments are parsed by the shell, so use shell
# quoting if necessary
[credential]
	helper = "foo --bar='whitespace arg'"

# you can also use an absolute path, which will not use the git wrapper
[credential]
	helper = "/path/to/my/helper --with-arguments"

# or you can specify your own shell snippet
[credential "https://example.com"]
	username = your_user
	helper = "!f() { test \"$1\" = get &amp;&amp; echo \"password=$(cat $HOME/.secret)\"; }; f"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally speaking, rule (3) above is the simplest for users to specify.
Authors of credential helpers should make an effort to assist their
users by naming their program "git-credential-$NAME", and putting it in
the <code>$PATH</code> or <code>$GIT_EXEC_PATH</code> during installation, which will allow a
user to enable it with <code>git config credential.helper $NAME</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a helper is executed, it will have one "operation" argument
appended to its command line, which is one of:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-codegetcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-codegetcode"></a><code>get</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>Return a matching credential, if any exists.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-codestorecode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-codestorecode"></a><code>store</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>Store the credential, if applicable to the helper.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-codeerasecode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/gitcredentials.txt-codeerasecode"></a><code>erase</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>Remove matching credentials, if any, from the helper&#8217;s storage.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The details of the credential will be provided on the helper&#8217;s stdin
stream. The exact format is the same as the input/output format of the
<code>git credential</code> plumbing command (see the section <code>INPUT/OUTPUT
FORMAT</code> in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-credential" >}}'>git-credential[1]</a> for a detailed specification).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a <code>get</code> operation, the helper should produce a list of attributes on
stdout in the same format (see <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-credential" >}}'>git-credential[1]</a> for common
attributes). A helper is free to produce a subset, or even no values at
all if it has nothing useful to provide. Any provided attributes will
overwrite those already known about by Git&#8217;s credential subsystem.
Unrecognised attributes are silently discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it is possible to override all attributes, well behaving helpers
should refrain from doing so for any attribute other than username and
password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a helper outputs a <code>quit</code> attribute with a value of <code>true</code> or <code>1</code>,
no further helpers will be consulted, nor will the user be prompted
(if no credential has been provided, the operation will then fail).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, no more helpers will be consulted once both username and
password had been provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a <code>store</code> or <code>erase</code> operation, the helper&#8217;s output is ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a helper fails to perform the requested operation or needs to notify
the user of a potential issue, it may write to stderr.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it does not support the requested operation (e.g., a read-only store
or generator), it should silently ignore the request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a helper receives any other operation, it should silently ignore the
request. This leaves room for future operations to be added (older
helpers will just ignore the new requests).</p>
