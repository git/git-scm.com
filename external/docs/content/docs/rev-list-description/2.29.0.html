<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>List commits that are reachable by following the <code>parent</code> links from the
given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s)
given with a <em>^</em> in front of them.  The output is given in reverse
chronological order by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from any of
the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits reachable
from any of the ones given with <em>^</em> in front are subtracted from that
set.  The remaining commits are what comes out in the command&#8217;s output.
Various other options and paths parameters can be used to further limit the
result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>means "list all the commits which are reachable from <em>foo</em> or <em>bar</em>, but
not from <em>baz</em>".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A special notation "<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em>..<em>&lt;commit2&gt;</em>" can be used as a
short-hand for "^<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em> <em>&lt;commit2&gt;</em>". For example, either of
the following may be used interchangeably:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another special notation is "<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em>&#8230;&#8203;<em>&lt;commit2&gt;</em>" which is useful
for merges.  The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference
between the two operands.  The following two commands are equivalent:</p>
