<h2 id="_description"><a class="anchor" href="#_description"></a>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git supports transferring data in packfiles over the ssh://, git://, http:// and
file:// transports.  There exist two sets of protocols, one for pushing
data from a client to a server and another for fetching data from a
server to a client.  The three transports (ssh, git, file) use the same
protocol to transfer data. http is documented in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitprotocol-http" >}}'>gitprotocol-http[5]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The processes invoked in the canonical Git implementation are <em>upload-pack</em>
on the server side and <em>fetch-pack</em> on the client side for fetching data;
then <em>receive-pack</em> on the server and <em>send-pack</em> on the client for pushing
data.  The protocol functions to have a server tell a client what is
currently on the server, then for the two to negotiate the smallest amount
of data to send in order to fully update one or the other.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_pkt_line_format"><a class="anchor" href="#_pkt_line_format"></a>pkt-line Format</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The descriptions below build on the pkt-line format described in
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitprotocol-common" >}}'>gitprotocol-common[5]</a>. When the grammar indicates <code>PKT-LINE(...)</code>, unless
otherwise noted the usual pkt-line LF rules apply: the sender SHOULD
include a LF, but the receiver MUST NOT complain if it is not present.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An error packet is a special pkt-line that contains an error string.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  error-line     =  PKT-LINE("ERR" SP explanation-text)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout the protocol, where <code>PKT-LINE(...)</code> is expected, an error packet MAY
be sent. Once this packet is sent by a client or a server, the data transfer
process defined in this protocol is terminated.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_transports"><a class="anchor" href="#_transports"></a>Transports</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three transports over which the packfile protocol is
initiated.  The Git transport is a simple, unauthenticated server that
takes the command (almost always <em>upload-pack</em>, though Git
servers can be configured to be globally writable, in which <em>receive-
pack</em> initiation is also allowed) with which the client wishes to
communicate and executes it and connects it to the requesting
process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the SSH transport, the client just runs the <em>upload-pack</em>
or <em>receive-pack</em> process on the server over the SSH protocol and then
communicates with that invoked process over the SSH connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The file:// transport runs the <em>upload-pack</em> or <em>receive-pack</em>
process locally and communicates with it over a pipe.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_extra_parameters"><a class="anchor" href="#_extra_parameters"></a>Extra Parameters</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The protocol provides a mechanism in which clients can send additional
information in its first message to the server. These are called "Extra
Parameters", and are supported by the Git, SSH, and HTTP protocols.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each Extra Parameter takes the form of <code>&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;key&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Servers that receive any such Extra Parameters MUST ignore all
unrecognized keys. Currently, the only Extra Parameter recognized is
"version" with a value of <em>1</em> or <em>2</em>.  See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitprotocol-v2" >}}'>gitprotocol-v2[5]</a> for more
information on protocol version 2.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_git_transport"><a class="anchor" href="#_git_transport"></a>Git Transport</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Git transport starts off by sending the command and repository
on the wire using the pkt-line format, followed by a NUL byte and a
hostname parameter, terminated by a NUL byte.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>0033git-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transport may send Extra Parameters by adding an additional NUL
byte, and then adding one or more NUL-terminated strings:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>003egit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0\0version=1\0</pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically what the Git client is doing to connect to an <em>upload-pack</em>
process on the server side over the Git protocol is this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">

<h2 id="_ssh_transport"><a class="anchor" href="#_ssh_transport"></a>SSH Transport</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initiating the upload-pack or receive-pack processes over SSH is
executing the binary on the server via SSH remote execution.
It is basically equivalent to running this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ ssh git.example.com "git-upload-pack '/project.git'"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a server to support Git pushing and pulling for a given user over
SSH, that user needs to be able to execute one or both of those
commands via the SSH shell that they are provided on login.  On some
systems, that shell access is limited to only being able to run those
two commands, or even just one of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an ssh:// format URI, it&#8217;s absolute in the URI, so the <em>/</em> after
the host name (or port number) is sent as an argument, which is then
read by the remote git-upload-pack exactly as is, so it&#8217;s effectively
an absolute path in the remote filesystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>   git clone ssh://user@example.com/project.git
  |
  v
ssh user@example.com "git-upload-pack '/project.git'"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a "user@host:path" format URI, it&#8217;s relative to the user&#8217;s home
directory, because the Git client will run:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>   git clone user@example.com:project.git
    |
    v
ssh user@example.com "git-upload-pack 'project.git'"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The exception is if a <em>~</em> is used, in which case
we execute it without the leading <em>/</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>   ssh://user@example.com/~alice/project.git,
    |
    v
ssh user@example.com "git-upload-pack '~alice/project.git'"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the value of the <code>protocol.version</code> configuration variable,
Git may attempt to send Extra Parameters as a colon-separated string in
the GIT_PROTOCOL environment variable. This is done only if
the <code>ssh.variant</code> configuration variable indicates that the ssh command
supports passing environment variables as an argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few things to remember here:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The "command name" is spelled with dash (e.g. git-upload-pack), but
this can be overridden by the client;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The repository path is always quoted with single quotes.</p>

<h2 id="_packfile_negotiation"><a class="anchor" href="#_packfile_negotiation"></a>Packfile Negotiation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After reference and capabilities discovery, the client can decide to
terminate the connection by sending a flush-pkt, telling the server it can
now gracefully terminate, and disconnect, when it does not need any pack
data. This can happen with the ls-remote command, and also can happen when
the client already is up to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise, it enters the negotiation phase, where the client and
server determine what the minimal packfile necessary for transport is,
by telling the server what objects it wants, its shallow objects
(if any), and the maximum commit depth it wants (if any).  The client
will also send a list of the capabilities it wants to be in effect,
out of what the server said it could do with the first <em>want</em> line.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

  filter-request    =  PKT-LINE("filter" SP filter-spec)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clients MUST send all the obj-ids it wants from the reference
discovery phase as <em>want</em> lines. Clients MUST send at least one
<em>want</em> command in the request body. Clients MUST NOT mention an
obj-id in a <em>want</em> command which did not appear in the response
obtained through ref discovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The client MUST write all obj-ids which it only has shallow copies
of (meaning that it does not have the parents of a commit) as
<em>shallow</em> lines so that the server is aware of the limitations of
the client&#8217;s history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The client now sends the maximum commit history depth it wants for
this transaction, which is the number of commits it wants from the
tip of the history, if any, as a <em>deepen</em> line.  A depth of 0 is the
same as not making a depth request. The client does not want to receive
any commits beyond this depth, nor does it want objects needed only to
complete those commits. Commits whose parents are not received as a
result are defined as shallow and marked as such in the server. This
information is sent back to the client in the next step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The client can optionally request that pack-objects omit various
objects from the packfile using one of several filtering techniques.
These are intended for use with partial clone and partial fetch
operations. An object that does not meet a filter-spec value is
omitted unless explicitly requested in a <em>want</em> line. See <code>rev-list</code>
for possible filter-spec values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once all the <em>want&#8217;s and 'shallow&#8217;s (and optional 'deepen</em>) are
transferred, clients MUST send a flush-pkt, to tell the server side
that it is done sending the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise, if the client sent a positive depth request, the server
will determine which commits will and will not be shallow and
send this information to the client. If the client did not request
a positive depth, this step is skipped.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  shallow-update   =  *shallow-line

  unshallow-line   =  PKT-LINE("unshallow" SP obj-id)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the client has requested a positive depth, the server will compute
the set of commits which are no deeper than the desired depth. The set
of commits starts at the client&#8217;s wants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The server writes <em>shallow</em> lines for each
commit whose parents will not be sent as a result. The server writes
an <em>unshallow</em> line for each commit which the client has indicated is
shallow, but is no longer shallow at the currently requested depth
(that is, its parents will now be sent). The server MUST NOT mark
as unshallow anything which the client has not indicated was shallow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the client will send a list of the obj-ids it has using <em>have</em>
lines, so the server can make a packfile that only contains the objects
that the client needs. In multi_ack mode, the canonical implementation
will send up to 32 of these at a time, then will send a flush-pkt. The
canonical implementation will skip ahead and send the next 32 immediately,
so that there is always a block of 32 "in-flight on the wire" at a time.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the server reads <em>have</em> lines, it then will respond by ACKing any
of the obj-ids the client said it had that the server also has. The
server will ACK obj-ids differently depending on which ack mode is
chosen by the client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In multi_ack mode:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the server will respond with <em>ACK obj-id continue</em> for any common
commits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once the server has found an acceptable common base commit and is
ready to make a packfile, it will blindly ACK all <em>have</em> obj-ids
back to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the server will then send a <em>NAK</em> and then wait for another response
from the client - either a <em>done</em> or another list of <em>have</em> lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In multi_ack_detailed mode:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the server will differentiate the ACKs where it is signaling
that it is ready to send data with <em>ACK obj-id ready</em> lines, and
signals the identified common commits with <em>ACK obj-id common</em> lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without either multi_ack or multi_ack_detailed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>upload-pack sends "ACK obj-id" on the first common object it finds.
After that it says nothing until the client gives it a "done".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>upload-pack sends "NAK" on a flush-pkt if no common object
has been found yet.  If one has been found, and thus an ACK
was already sent, it&#8217;s silent on the flush-pkt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the client has gotten enough ACK responses that it can determine
that the server has enough information to send an efficient packfile
(in the canonical implementation, this is determined when it has received
enough ACKs that it can color everything left in the --date-order queue
as common with the server, or the --date-order queue is empty), or the
client determines that it wants to give up (in the canonical implementation,
this is determined when the client sends 256 <em>have</em> lines without getting
any of them ACKed by the server - meaning there is nothing in common and
the server should just send all of its objects), then the client will send
a <em>done</em> command.  The <em>done</em> command signals to the server that the client
is ready to receive its packfile data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the 256 limit <strong>only</strong> turns on in the canonical client
implementation if we have received at least one "ACK %s continue"
during a prior round.  This helps to ensure that at least one common
ancestor is found before we give up entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the <em>done</em> line is read from the client, the server will either
send a final <em>ACK obj-id</em> or it will send a <em>NAK</em>. <em>obj-id</em> is the object
name of the last commit determined to be common. The server only sends
ACK after <em>done</em> if there is at least one common base and multi_ack or
multi_ack_detailed is enabled. The server always sends NAK after <em>done</em>
if there is no common base found.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of <em>ACK</em> or <em>NAK</em>, the server may send an error message (for
example, if it does not recognize an object in a <em>want</em> line received
from the client).</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that the client and server have finished negotiation about what
the minimal amount of data that needs to be sent to the client is, the server
will construct and send the required data in packfile format.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitformat-pack" >}}'>gitformat-pack[5]</a> for what the packfile itself actually looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <em>side-band</em> or <em>side-band-64k</em> capabilities have been specified by
the client, the server will send the packfile data multiplexed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each packet starting with the packet-line length of the amount of data
that follows, followed by a single byte specifying the sideband the
following data is coming in on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <em>side-band</em> mode, it will send up to 999 data bytes plus 1 control
code, for a total of up to 1000 bytes in a pkt-line.  In <em>side-band-64k</em>
mode it will send up to 65519 data bytes plus 1 control code, for a
total of up to 65520 bytes in a pkt-line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sideband byte will be a <em>1</em>, <em>2</em> or a <em>3</em>. Sideband <em>1</em> will contain
packfile data, sideband <em>2</em> will be used for progress information that the
client will generally print to stderr and sideband <em>3</em> is used for error
information.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pushing data to a server will invoke the <em>receive-pack</em> process on the
server, which will allow the client to tell it which references it should
update and then send all the data the server will need for those new
references to be complete.  Once all the data is received and validated,
the server will then update its references to what the client specified.</p>

<p>The protocol itself contains no authentication mechanisms.  That is to be
handled by the transport, such as SSH, before the <em>receive-pack</em> process is

that transport is unauthenticated.</p>

<p>The reference discovery phase is done nearly the same way as it is in the
fetching protocol. Each reference obj-id and name on the server is sent
in packet-line format to the client, followed by a flush-pkt.  The only
real difference is that the capability listing is different - the only
possible values are <em>report-status</em>, <em>report-status-v2</em>, <em>delete-refs</em>,
<em>ofs-delta</em>, <em>atomic</em> and <em>push-options</em>.</p>

cert and push options, it MUST send its push options both embedded within the

MUST be the same, modulo the prefix.</p>

<p>A packfile MUST be sent if either create or update command is used,

a new branch or a tag that points to an existing obj-id.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The server will receive the packfile, unpack it, then validate each
reference that is being updated that it hasn&#8217;t changed while the request
was being processed (the obj-id is still the same as the old-id), and
it will run any update hooks to make sure that the update is acceptable.
If all of that is fine, the server will then update the references.</p>

someone pushed in the meantime.  The reference being pushed could be a

set to not allow that, etc.  Also, some references can be updated while others
can be rejected.</p>
