<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to check
out more than one branch at a time.  With <code>git worktree add</code> a new working
tree is associated with the repository, along with additional metadata
that differentiates that working tree from others in the same repository.
The working tree, along with this metadata, is called a "worktree".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This new worktree is called a "linked worktree" as opposed to the "main
worktree" prepared by <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-init" >}}'>git-init[1]</a> or <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-clone" >}}'>git-clone[1]</a>.
A repository has one main worktree (if it&#8217;s not a bare repository) and
zero or more linked worktrees. When you are done with a linked worktree,
remove it with <code>git worktree remove</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In its simplest form, <code>git worktree add &lt;path&gt;</code> automatically creates a
new branch whose name is the final component of <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>, which is
convenient if you plan to work on a new topic. For instance, <code>git
worktree add ../hotfix</code> creates new branch <code>hotfix</code> and checks it out at
path <code>../hotfix</code>. To instead work on an existing branch in a new worktree,
use <code>git worktree add &lt;path&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code>. On the other hand, if you just
plan to make some experimental changes or do testing without disturbing
existing development, it is often convenient to create a <em>throwaway</em>
worktree not associated with any branch. For instance,
<code>git worktree add -d &lt;path&gt;</code> creates a new worktree with a detached <code>HEAD</code>
at the same commit as the current branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a working tree is deleted without using <code>git worktree remove</code>, then
its associated administrative files, which reside in the repository
(see "DETAILS" below), will eventually be removed automatically (see
<code>gc.worktreePruneExpire</code> in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a>), or you can run
<code>git worktree prune</code> in the main or any linked worktree to clean up any
stale administrative files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the working tree for a linked worktree is stored on a portable device
or network share which is not always mounted, you can prevent its
administrative files from being pruned by issuing the <code>git worktree lock</code>
command, optionally specifying <code>--reason</code> to explain why the worktree is
locked.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-worktree.txt-addltpathgtltcommit-ishgt"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-worktree.txt-addltpathgtltcommit-ishgt"></a>add &lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit-ish&gt;] </dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a worktree at <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> and checkout <code>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</code> into it. The new worktree
is linked to the current repository, sharing everything except per-worktree
files such as <code>HEAD</code>, <code>index</code>, etc. As a convenience, <code>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</code> may
be a bare "<code>-</code>", which is synonymous with <code>@{-1}</code>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <code>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</code> is a branch name (call it <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code>) and is not found,
and neither <code>-b</code> nor <code>-B</code> nor <code>--detach</code> are used, but there does
exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code>)
with a matching name, treat as equivalent to:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git worktree add --track -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;path&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by
the <code>checkout.defaultRemote</code> configuration variable, we&#8217;ll use that
one for the purposes of disambiguation, even if the <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> isn&#8217;t
unique across all remotes. Set it to
e.g. <code>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</code> to always checkout remote
branches from there if <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> is ambiguous but exists on the
<code>origin</code> remote. See also <code>checkout.defaultRemote</code> in
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <code>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</code> is omitted and neither <code>-b</code> nor <code>-B</code> nor <code>--detach</code> used,
then, as a convenience, the new worktree is associated with a branch (call
it <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code>) named after <code>$(basename &lt;path&gt;)</code>.  If <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> doesn&#8217;t
exist, a new branch based on <code>HEAD</code> is automatically created as if
<code>-b &lt;branch&gt;</code> was given.  If <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> does exist, it will be checked out
in the new worktree, if it&#8217;s not checked out anywhere else, otherwise the
command will refuse to create the worktree (unless <code>--force</code> is used).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <code>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</code> is omitted, neither <code>--detach</code>, or <code>--orphan</code> is
used, and there are no valid local branches (or remote branches if
<code>--guess-remote</code> is specified) then, as a convenience, the new worktree is
associated with a new unborn branch named <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> (after
<code>$(basename &lt;path&gt;)</code> if neither <code>-b</code> or <code>-B</code> is used) as if <code>--orphan</code> was
passed to the command. In the event the repository has a remote and
<code>--guess-remote</code> is used, but no remote or local branches exist, then the
command fails with a warning reminding the user to fetch from their remote
first (or override by using <code>-f/--force</code>).</p>

<p>List details of each worktree.  The main worktree is listed first,
followed by each of the linked worktrees.  The output details include
whether the worktree is bare, the revision currently checked out, the
branch currently checked out (or "detached HEAD" if none), "locked" if
the worktree is locked, "prunable" if the worktree can be pruned by the
<code>prune</code> command.</p>

<dd>
<p>If a worktree is on a portable device or network share which is not always
mounted, lock it to prevent its administrative files from being pruned
automatically. This also prevents it from being moved or deleted.
Optionally, specify a reason for the lock with <code>--reason</code>.</p>

<p>Move a worktree to a new location. Note that the main worktree or linked
worktrees containing submodules cannot be moved with this command. (The
<code>git worktree repair</code> command, however, can reestablish the connection
with linked worktrees if you move the main worktree manually.)</p>

<dd>
<p>Remove a worktree. Only clean worktrees (no untracked files and no
modification in tracked files) can be removed. Unclean worktrees or ones
with submodules can be removed with <code>--force</code>. The main worktree cannot be

<p>Repair worktree administrative files, if possible, if they have become
corrupted or outdated due to external factors.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, if the main worktree (or bare repository) is moved, linked
worktrees will be unable to locate it. Running <code>repair</code> in the main
worktree will reestablish the connection from linked worktrees back to the
main worktree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, if the working tree for a linked worktree is moved without
using <code>git worktree move</code>, the main worktree (or bare repository) will be
unable to locate it. Running <code>repair</code> within the recently-moved worktree
will reestablish the connection. If multiple linked worktrees are moved,
running <code>repair</code> from any worktree with each tree&#8217;s new <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> as an
argument, will reestablish the connection to all the specified paths.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If both the main worktree and linked worktrees have been moved manually,

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using multiple worktrees, some refs are shared between all worktrees,
but others are specific to an individual worktree. One example is <code>HEAD</code>,
which is different for each worktree. This section is about the sharing
rules and how to access refs of one worktree from another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, all pseudo refs are per-worktree and all refs starting with
<code>refs/</code> are shared. Pseudo refs are ones like <code>HEAD</code> which are directly
under <code>$GIT_DIR</code> instead of inside <code>$GIT_DIR/refs</code>. There are exceptions,
however: refs inside <code>refs/bisect</code>, <code>refs/worktree</code> and <code>refs/rewritten</code> are
not shared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Refs that are per-worktree can still be accessed from another worktree via
two special paths, <code>main-worktree</code> and <code>worktrees</code>. The former gives
access to per-worktree refs of the main worktree, while the latter to all
linked worktrees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, <code>main-worktree/HEAD</code> or <code>main-worktree/refs/bisect/good</code>
resolve to the same value as the main worktree&#8217;s <code>HEAD</code> and
<code>refs/bisect/good</code> respectively. Similarly, <code>worktrees/foo/HEAD</code> or
<code>worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</code> are the same as
<code>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/foo/HEAD</code> and
<code>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To access refs, it&#8217;s best not to look inside <code>$GIT_DIR</code> directly. Instead
use commands such as <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-rev-parse" >}}'>git-rev-parse[1]</a> or <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-update-ref" >}}'>git-update-ref[1]</a>

<p>Within a linked worktree, <code>$GIT_DIR</code> is set to point to this private
directory (e.g. <code>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</code> in the example) and
<code>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</code> is set to point back to the main worktree&#8217;s <code>$GIT_DIR</code>
(e.g. <code>/path/main/.git</code>). These settings are made in a <code>.git</code> file located at
the top directory of the linked worktree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Path resolution via <code>git rev-parse --git-path</code> uses either
<code>$GIT_DIR</code> or <code>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</code> depending on the path. For example, in the
linked worktree <code>git rev-parse --git-path HEAD</code> returns
<code>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD</code> (not
<code>/path/other/test-next/.git/HEAD</code> or <code>/path/main/.git/HEAD</code>) while <code>git
rev-parse --git-path refs/heads/master</code> uses
<code>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</code> and returns <code>/path/main/.git/refs/heads/master</code>,
since refs are shared across all worktrees, except <code>refs/bisect</code>,
<code>refs/worktree</code> and <code>refs/rewritten</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitrepository-layout" >}}'>gitrepository-layout[5]</a> for more information. The rule of
thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a path belongs to
<code>$GIT_DIR</code> or <code>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</code> when you need to directly access something
inside <code>$GIT_DIR</code>. Use <code>git rev-parse --git-path</code> to get the final path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you manually move a linked worktree, you need to update the <code>gitdir</code> file
in the entry&#8217;s directory. For example, if a linked worktree is moved
to <code>/newpath/test-next</code> and its <code>.git</code> file points to
<code>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</code>, then update
<code>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir</code> to reference <code>/newpath/test-next</code>
instead. Better yet, run <code>git worktree repair</code> to reestablish the connection
automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To prevent a <code>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</code> entry from being pruned (which
can be useful in some situations, such as when the
entry&#8217;s worktree is stored on a portable device), use the
<code>git worktree lock</code> command, which adds a file named
<code>locked</code> to the entry&#8217;s directory. The file contains the reason in
plain text. For example, if a linked worktree&#8217;s <code>.git</code> file points
to <code>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</code> then a file named
<code>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked</code> will prevent the
<code>test-next</code> entry from being pruned.  See
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitrepository-layout" >}}'>gitrepository-layout[5]</a> for details.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <code>extensions.worktreeConfig</code> is enabled, the config file
<code>.git/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree</code> is read after <code>.git/config</code> is.</p>

<h2 id="_list_output_format"><a class="anchor" href="#_list_output_format"></a>LIST OUTPUT FORMAT</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>worktree list</code> command has two output formats. The default format shows the
details on a single line with columns.  For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git worktree list
/path/to/bare-source            (bare)
/path/to/linked-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/other-linked-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command also shows annotations for each worktree, according to its state.
These annotations are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>locked</code>, if the worktree is locked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>prunable</code>, if the worktree can be pruned via <code>git worktree prune</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git worktree list
/path/to/linked-worktree    abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/locked-worktree    acbd5678 (brancha) locked
/path/to/prunable-worktree  5678abc  (detached HEAD) prunable</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these annotations, a reason might also be available and this can be
seen using the verbose mode. The annotation is then moved to the next line
indented followed by the additional information.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git worktree list --verbose
/path/to/linked-worktree              abcd1234 [master]

/path/to/prunable-worktree            5678abc1 (detached HEAD)
	prunable: gitdir file points to non-existent location</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the annotation is moved to the next line if the additional
information is available, otherwise it stays on the same line as the
worktree itself.</p>

<h3 id="_porcelain_format"><a class="anchor" href="#_porcelain_format"></a>Porcelain Format</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The porcelain format has a line per attribute.  If <code>-z</code> is given then the lines
are terminated with NUL rather than a newline.  Attributes are listed with a
label and value separated by a single space.  Boolean attributes (like <code>bare</code>
and <code>detached</code>) are listed as a label only, and are present only
if the value is true.  Some attributes (like <code>locked</code>) can be listed as a label
only or with a value depending upon whether a reason is available.  The first
attribute of a worktree is always <code>worktree</code>, an empty line indicates the
end of the record.  For example:</p>
