<h3 id="_terminology"><a class="anchor" href="#_terminology"></a>Terminology</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>cone mode: one of two modes for specifying the desired subset of files
	in a sparse-checkout.  In cone-mode, the user specifies
	directories (getting both everything under that directory as
	well as everything in leading directories), while in non-cone
	mode, the user specifies gitignore-style patterns.  Controlled
	by the --[no-]cone option to sparse-checkout init|set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SKIP_WORKTREE: When tracked files do not match the sparse specification and
	are removed from the working tree, the file in the index is marked
	with a SKIP_WORKTREE bit.  Note that if a tracked file has the
	SKIP_WORKTREE bit set but the file is later written by the user to
	the working tree anyway, the SKIP_WORKTREE bit will be cleared at
	the beginning of any subsequent Git operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Most sparse checkout users are unaware of this implementation
detail, and the term should generally be avoided in user-facing
descriptions and command flags.  Unfortunately, prior to the
`sparse-checkout` subcommand this low-level detail was exposed,
and as of time of writing, is still exposed in various places.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sparse-checkout: a subcommand in git used to reduce the files present in
	the working tree to a subset of all tracked files.  Also, the
	name of the file in the $GIT_DIR/info directory used to track
	the sparsity patterns corresponding to the user&#8217;s desired
	subset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sparse cone: see cone mode</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sparse directory: An entry in the index corresponding to a directory, which
	appears in the index instead of all the files under that directory
	that would normally appear.  See also sparse-index.  Something that
	can cause confusion is that the "sparse directory" does NOT match
	the sparse specification, i.e. the directory is NOT present in the
	working tree.  May be renamed in the future (e.g. to "skipped
	directory").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sparse index: A special mode for sparse-checkout that also makes the
	index sparse by recording a directory entry in lieu of all the
	files underneath that directory (thus making that a "skipped
	directory" which unfortunately has also been called a "sparse
	directory"), and does this for potentially multiple
	directories.  Controlled by the --[no-]sparse-index option to
	init|set|reapply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sparsity patterns: patterns from $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout used to
	define the set of files of interest.  A warning: It is easy to
	over-use this term (or the shortened "patterns" term), for two
	reasons: (1) users in cone mode specify directories rather than
	patterns (their directories are transformed into patterns, but
	users may think you are talking about non-cone mode if you use the
	word "patterns"), and (b) the sparse specification might
	transiently differ in the working tree or index from the sparsity
	patterns (see "Sparse specification vs. sparsity patterns").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sparse specification: The set of paths in the user&#8217;s area of focus.  This
	is typically just the tracked files that match the sparsity
	patterns, but the sparse specification can temporarily differ and
	include additional files.  (See also "Sparse specification
	vs. sparsity patterns")</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When working with history, the sparse specification is exactly
the set of files matching the sparsity patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When interacting with the working tree, the sparse specification
is the set of tracked files with a clear SKIP_WORKTREE bit or
tracked files present in the working copy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When modifying or showing results from the index, the sparse
specification is the set of files with a clear SKIP_WORKTREE bit
or that differ in the index from HEAD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If working with the index and the working copy, the sparse
specification is the union of the paths from above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>vivifying: When a command restores a tracked file to the working tree (and
	hopefully also clears the SKIP_WORKTREE bit in the index for that
	file), this is referred to as "vivifying" the file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_purpose_of_sparse_checkouts"><a class="anchor" href="#_purpose_of_sparse_checkouts"></a>Purpose of sparse-checkouts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sparse-checkouts exist to allow users to work with a subset of their
files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can think of sparse-checkouts as subdividing "tracked" files into two
categories&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a sparse subset, and all the rest.  Implementationally, we
mark "all the rest" in the index with a SKIP_WORKTREE bit and leave them
out of the working tree.  The SKIP_WORKTREE files are still tracked, just
not present in the working tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the past, sparse-checkouts were defined by "SKIP_WORKTREE means the file
is missing from the working tree but pretend the file contents match HEAD".
That was not only bogus (it actually meant the file missing from the
working tree matched the index rather than HEAD), but it was also a
low-level detail which only provided decent behavior for a few commands.
There were a surprising number of ways in which that guiding principle gave
command results that violated user expectations, and as such was a bad
mental model.  However, it persisted for many years and may still be found
in some corners of the code base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, the idea of "working with a subset of files" is simple enough, but
there are multiple different high-level usecases which affect how some Git
subcommands should behave.  Further, even if we only considered one of
those usecases, sparse-checkouts can modify different subcommands in over a
half dozen different ways.  Let&#8217;s start by considering the high level
usecases:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>A) Users are _only_ interested in the sparse portion of the repo</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>A*) Users are _only_ interested in the sparse portion of the repo
    that they have downloaded so far</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>B) Users want a sparse working tree, but are working in a larger whole</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>C) sparse-checkout is a behind-the-scenes implementation detail allowing
   Git to work with a specially crafted in-house virtual file system;
   users are actually working with a "full" working tree that is
   lazily populated, and sparse-checkout helps with the lazy population
   piece.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may be worth explaining each of these in a bit more detail:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(Behavior A) Users are _only_ interested in the sparse portion of the repo</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These folks might know there are other things in the repository, but
don&#8217;t care.  They are uninterested in other parts of the repository, and
only want to know about changes within their area of interest.  Showing
them other files from history (e.g. from diff/log/grep/etc.)  is a
usability annoyance, potentially a huge one since other changes in
history may dwarf the changes they are interested in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these users also arrive at this usecase from wanting to use partial
clones together with sparse checkouts (in a way where they have downloaded
blobs within the sparse specification) and do disconnected development.
Not only do these users generally not care about other parts of the
repository, but consider it a blocker for Git commands to try to operate on
those.  If commands attempt to access paths in history outside the sparsity
specification, then the partial clone will attempt to download additional
blobs on demand, fail, and then fail the user&#8217;s command.  (This may be
unavoidable in some cases, e.g. when <code>git merge</code> has non-trivial changes to
reconcile outside the sparse specification, but we should limit how often
users are forced to connect to the network.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, even for users using partial clones that do not mind being
always connected to the network, the need to download blobs as
side-effects of various other commands (such as the printed diffstat
after a merge or pull) can lead to worries about local repository size
growing unnecessarily[10].</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(Behavior A*) Users are _only_ interested in the sparse portion of the repo
    that they have downloaded so far (a variant on the first usecase)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This variant is driven by folks who using partial clones together with
sparse checkouts and do disconnected development (so far sounding like a
subset of behavior A users) and doing so on very large repositories.  The
reason for yet another variant is that downloading even just the blobs
through history within their sparse specification may be too much, so they
only download some.  They would still like operations to succeed without
network connectivity, though, so things like <code>git log -S${SEARCH_TERM} -p</code>
or `git grep ${SEARCH_TERM} OLDREV ` would need to be prepared to provide
partial results that depend on what happens to have been downloaded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This variant could be viewed as Behavior A with the sparse specification
for history querying operations modified from "sparsity patterns" to
"sparsity patterns limited to the blobs we have already downloaded".</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(Behavior B) Users want a sparse working tree, but are working in a
    larger whole</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stolee described this usecase this way[11]:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I&#8217;m also focused on users that know that they are a part of a larger
whole. They know they are operating on a large repository but focus on
what they need to contribute their part. I expect multiple "roles" to
use very different, almost disjoint parts of the codebase. Some other
"architect" users operate across the entire tree or hop between different
sections of the codebase as necessary. In this situation, I&#8217;m wary of
scoping too many features to the sparse-checkout definition, especially
"git log," as it can be too confusing to have their view of the codebase
depend on your "point of view."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People might also end up wanting behavior B due to complex inter-project
dependencies.  The initial attempts to use sparse-checkouts usually involve
the directories you are directly interested in plus what those directories
depend upon within your repository.  But there&#8217;s a monkey wrench here: if
you have integration tests, they invert the hierarchy: to run integration
tests, you need not only what you are interested in and its in-tree
dependencies, you also need everything that depends upon what you are
interested in or that depends upon one of your dependencies&#8230;&#8203;AND you need
all the in-tree dependencies of that expanded group.  That can easily
change your sparse-checkout into a nearly dense one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Naturally, that tends to kill the benefits of sparse-checkouts.  There are
a couple solutions to this conundrum: either avoid grabbing in-repo
dependencies (maybe have built versions of your in-repo dependencies pulled
from a CI cache somewhere), or say that users shouldn&#8217;t run integration
tests directly and instead do it on the CI server when they submit a code
review.  Or do both.  Regardless of whether you stub out your in-repo
dependencies or stub out the things that depend upon you, there is
certainly a reason to want to query and be aware of those other stubbed-out
parts of the repository, particularly when the dependencies are complex or
change relatively frequently.  Thus, for such uses, sparse-checkouts can be
used to limit what you directly build and modify, but these users do not
necessarily want their sparse checkout paths to limit their queries of
versions in history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people may also be interested in behavior B over behavior A simply as
a performance workaround: if they are using non-cone mode, then they have
to deal with its inherent quadratic performance problems.  In that mode,
every operation that checks whether paths match the sparsity specification
can be expensive.  As such, these users may only be willing to pay for
those expensive checks when interacting with the working copy, and may
prefer getting "unrelated" results from their history queries over having
slow commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(Behavior C) sparse-checkout is an implementational detail supporting a
      special VFS.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This usecase goes slightly against the traditional definition of
sparse-checkout in that it actually tries to present a full or dense
checkout to the user.  However, this usecase utilizes the same underlying
technical underpinnings in a new way which does provide some performance
advantages to users.  The basic idea is that a company can have an in-house
Git-aware Virtual File System which pretends all files are present in the
working tree, by intercepting all file system accesses and using those to
fetch and write accessed files on demand via partial clones.  The VFS uses
sparse-checkout to prevent Git from writing or paying attention to many
files, and manually updates the sparse checkout patterns itself based on
user access and modification of files in the working tree.  See commit
ecc7c8841d ("repo_read_index: add config to expect files outside sparse
patterns", 2022-02-25) and the link at [17] for a more detailed description
of such a VFS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The biggest difference here is that users are completely unaware that the
sparse-checkout machinery is even in use.  The sparse patterns are not
specified by the user but rather are under the complete control of the VFS
(and the patterns are updated frequently and dynamically by it).  The user
will perceive the checkout as dense, and commands should thus behave as if
all files are present.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_usecases_of_primary_concern"><a class="anchor" href="#_usecases_of_primary_concern"></a>Usecases of primary concern</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the rest of this document will focus on Behavior A and Behavior
B.  Some notes about the other two cases and why we are not focusing on
them:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(Behavior A*)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supporting this usecase is estimated to be difficult and a lot of work.
There are no plans to implement it currently, but it may be a potential
future alternative.  Knowing about the existence of additional alternatives
may affect our choice of command line flags (e.g. if we need tri-state or
quad-state flags rather than just binary flags), so it was still important
to at least note.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further, I believe the descriptions below for Behavior A are probably still
valid for this usecase, with the only exception being that it redefines the
sparse specification to restrict it to already-downloaded blobs.  The hard
part is in making commands capable of respecting that modified definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(Behavior C)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This usecase violates some of the early sparse-checkout documented
assumptions (since files marked as SKIP_WORKTREE will be displayed to users
as present in the working tree).  That violation may mean various
sparse-checkout related behaviors are not well suited to this usecase and
we may need tweaks&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to both documentation and code&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to handle it.
However, this usecase is also perhaps the simplest model to support in that
everything behaves like a dense checkout with a few exceptions (e.g. branch
checkouts and switches write fewer things, knowing the VFS will lazily
write the rest on an as-needed basis).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since there is no publicly available VFS-related code for folks to try,
the number of folks who can test such a usecase is limited.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary reason to note the Behavior C usecase is that as we fix things
to better support Behaviors A and B, there may be additional places where
we need to make tweaks allowing folks in this usecase to get the original
non-sparse treatment.  For an example, see ecc7c8841d ("repo_read_index:
add config to expect files outside sparse patterns", 2022-02-25).  The
secondary reason to note Behavior C, is so that folks taking advantage of
Behavior C do not assume they are part of the Behavior B camp and propose
patches that break things for the real Behavior B folks.</p>

<div class="content">

Behavior B: Restrict worktree operations to sparse specification; have any
     history operations work across all files
Behavior C: Do not restrict either worktree or history operations to the

     switches which avoid writing files that will match the index so
     they can later lazily be populated instead.</pre>

<h3 id="_desired_behavior"><a class="anchor" href="#_desired_behavior"></a>Desired behavior</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted previously, despite the simple idea of just working with a subset
of files, there are a range of different behavioral changes that need to be
made to different subcommands to work well with such a feature.  See
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] for various examples.  In particular, at [2], we saw
that mere composition of other commands that individually worked correctly
in a sparse-checkout context did not imply that the higher level command
would work correctly; it sometimes requires further tweaks.  So,
understanding these differences can be beneficial.</p>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>   The behavior for these commands somewhat depends upon the merge
   strategy being used:
     * `ort` behaves as described above
     * `recursive` tries to not vivify files unnecessarily, but does sometimes
vivify files without conflicts.
     * `octopus` and `resolve` will always vivify any file changed in the merge
relative to the first parent, which is rather suboptimal.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>It is also important to note that these commands WILL update the index
outside the sparse specification relative to when the operation began,
BUT these commands often make a commit just before or after such that
by the end of the operation there is no change to the index outside the
sparse specification.  Of course, if the operation hits conflicts or
does not make a commit, then these operations clearly can modify the
index outside the sparse specification.</pre>

sparse specification.</pre>

<pre>Some of these commands may also attempt, at the end of their operation,
to cull transient differences between the sparse specification and the
sparsity patterns (see "Sparse specification vs. sparsity patterns" for

SKIP_WORKTREE, or vivifying files that match the sparsity patterns and

 except that:
   (1) they will ignore the sparse specification and write files with
conflicts to the working tree (thus temporarily expanding the
sparse specification to include such files.)
   (2) they are grouped with commands which move to a new commit, since
they often create a commit and then move to it, even though we
know there are many exceptions to moving to the new commit.  (For
example, the user may rebase a commit that becomes empty, or have
a cherry-pick which conflicts, or a user could run `merge
--no-commit`, and we also view `apply --index` kind of like `am
--no-commit`.)  As such, these commands can make changes to index
files outside the sparse specification, though they'll mark such
files with SKIP_WORKTREE.</pre>

message if the command had nothing to do, but the arguments may have
referred to files whose tracked-ness state could have changed were it
not for the sparsity patterns excluding them.</pre>

<pre>   Our original implementation for the first three of these commands was
   "no restrict", but it had some severe usability issues:
     * `git add &lt;somefile&gt;` if honored and outside the sparse
specification, can result in the file randomly disappearing later
when some subsequent command is run (since various commands
automatically clean up unmodified files outside the sparse
specification).
     * `git rm '*.jpg'` could very negatively surprise users if it deletes
files outside the range of the user's interest.
     * `git mv` has similar surprises when moving into or out of the cone,
so best to restrict by default</pre>

git add &lt;file-outside-sparse-specification&gt;
git rm &lt;file-outside-sparse-specification&gt;

<pre>"restrict" may make more sense as the long term default for these[12].
Also, supporting "restrict" for these commands might be a fair amount
of work to implement, meaning it might be implemented over multiple
releases.  If that behavior were the default in the commands that
supported it, that would force behavior B users to need to learn to
slowly add additional flags to their commands, depending on git
version, to get the behavior they want.  That gradual switchover would
be painful, so we should avoid it at least until it's fully
implemented.</pre>

<h3 id="_sparse_specification_vs_sparsity_patterns"><a class="anchor" href="#_sparse_specification_vs_sparsity_patterns"></a>Sparse specification vs. sparsity patterns</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a well-behaved situation, the sparse specification is given directly
by the $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout file.  However, it can transiently
diverge for a few reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>needing to resolve conflicts (merging will vivify conflicted files)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>running Git commands that implicitly vivify files (e.g. "git stash apply")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>running Git commands that explicitly vivify files (e.g. "git checkout
--ignore-skip-worktree-bits FILENAME")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other commands that write to these files (perhaps a user copies it
from elsewhere)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the last item, note that we do automatically clear the SKIP_WORKTREE
bit for files that are present in the working tree.  This has been true
since 82386b4496 ("Merge branch <em>en/present-despite-skipped</em>",
2022-03-09)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, such a situation is transient because:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Such transient differences can and will be automatically removed as
a side-effect of commands which call unpack_trees() (checkout,
merge, reset, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can also request such transient differences be corrected via
running <code>git sparse-checkout reapply</code>.  Various places recommend
running that command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional commands are also welcome to implicitly fix these
differences; we may add more in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we avoid dropping unstaged changes or files which have conflicts,
we otherwise aggressively try to fix these transient differences.  If
users want these differences to persist, they should run the <code>set</code> or
<code>add</code> subcommands of <code>git sparse-checkout</code> to reflect their intended
sparse specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when we need to do a query on history restricted to the
"relevant subset of files" such a transiently expanded sparse
specification is ignored.  There are a couple reasons for this:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The behavior wanted when doing something like
git grep expression REVISION
   is roughly what the users would expect from
git checkout REVISION &amp;&amp; git grep expression
   (modulo a "REVISION:" prefix), which has a couple ramifications:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REVISION may have paths not in the current index, so there is no
path we can consult for a SKIP_WORKTREE setting for those paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since <code>checkout</code> is one of those commands that tries to remove
transient differences in the sparse specification, it makes sense
to use the corrected sparse specification
(i.e. $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout) rather than attempting to
consult SKIP_WORKTREE anyway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, a transiently expanded (or restricted) sparse specification applies to
the working tree, but not to history queries where we always use the
sparsity patterns.  (See [16] for an early discussion of this.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to a transiently expanded sparse specification of the working tree
based on additional files being present in the working tree, we also need
to consider additional files being modified in the index.  In particular,
if the user has staged changes to files (relative to HEAD) that do not
match the sparsity patterns, and the file is not present in the working
tree, we still want to consider the file part of the sparse specification
if we are specifically performing a query related to the index (e.g. git
diff --cached [REVISION], git diff-index [REVISION], git restore --staged
--source=REVISION&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;PATHS, etc.)  Note that a transiently expanded sparse
specification for the index usually only matters under behavior A, since
under behavior B index operations are lumped with history and tend to
operate full-tree.</p>

<p>Do the options --scope={sparse,all} sound good to others?  Are there better

</li>
<li>
<p>--focus/--unfocus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>--limit/--unlimited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationale making me lean slightly towards --scope={sparse,all}:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want a name that works for many commands, so we need a name that
does not conflict</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know that we have more than two possible usecases, so it is best
to avoid a flag that appears to be binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>--scope={sparse,all} isn&#8217;t overly long and seems relatively
explanatory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--sparse</code>, as used in add/rm/mv, is totally backwards for
grep/log/etc.  Changing the meaning of <code>--sparse</code> for these
commands would fix the backwardness, but possibly break existing
scripts.  Using a new name pairing would allow us to treat
<code>--sparse</code> in these commands as a deprecated alias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a different <code>--sparse</code>/<code>--dense</code> pair for commands using
revision machinery, so using that naming might cause confusion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also a <code>--sparse</code> in both pack-objects and show-branch, which
don&#8217;t conflict but do suggest that <code>--sparse</code> is overloaded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name --ignore-skip-worktree-bits is a double negative, is
quite a mouthful, refers to an implementation detail that many
users may not be familiar with, and we&#8217;d need a negation for it
which would probably be even more ridiculously long.  (But we
can make --ignore-skip-worktree-bits a deprecated alias for
--no-restrict.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a config option is added (sparse.scope?) what should the values and
description be?  "sparse" (behavior A), "worktree-sparse-history-dense"
(behavior B), "dense" (behavior C)?  There&#8217;s a risk of confusion,
because even for Behaviors A and B we want some commands to be
full-tree and others to operate sparsely, so the wording may need to be
more tied to the usecases and somehow explain that.  Also, right now,
the primary difference we are focusing is just the history-querying
commands (log/diff/grep).  Previous config suggestion here: [13]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is <code>--no-expand</code> a good alias for ls-files&#8217;s <code>--sparse</code> option?
(<code>--sparse</code> does not map to either <code>--scope=sparse</code> or <code>--scope=all</code>,
because in non-cone mode it does nothing and in cone-mode it shows the
sparse directory entries which are technically outside the sparse
specification)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Behavior A:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does ls-files' <code>--no-expand</code> override the default <code>--scope=all</code>, or
does it need an extra flag?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does ls-files' <code>-t</code> option imply <code>--scope=all</code>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does update-index&#8217;s <code>--[no-]skip-worktree</code> option imply <code>--scope=all</code>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sparse-checkout: once behavior A is fully implemented, should we take
an interim measure to ease people into switching the default?  Namely,
if folks are not already in a sparse checkout, then require
<code>sparse-checkout init/set</code> to take a
<code>--set-scope=(sparse|worktree-sparse-history-dense|dense)</code> flag (which
would set sparse.scope according to the setting given), and throw an
error if the flag is not provided?  That error would be a great place
to warn folks that the default may change in the future, and get them
used to specifying what they want so that the eventual default switch
is seamless for them.</p>

<pre>apply, without `--index` or `--cached`, relies on files being present
in the working copy, and also writes to them unconditionally.  As
such, it should first check for the files' presence, and if found to
be SKIP_WORKTREE, then clear the bit and vivify the paths, then do
its work.  Currently, it just throws an error.</pre>
