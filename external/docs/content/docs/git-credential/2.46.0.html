<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git has an internal interface for storing and retrieving credentials
from system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user for
usernames and passwords. The git-credential command exposes this
interface to scripts which may want to retrieve, store, or prompt for
credentials in the same manner as Git. The design of this scriptable
interface models the internal C API; see credential.h for more
background on the concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>git-credential takes an "action" option on the command-line (one of
<code>fill</code>, <code>approve</code>, or <code>reject</code>) and reads a credential description
on stdin (see <a href="#IOFMT">INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the action is <code>fill</code>, git-credential will attempt to add "username"
and "password" attributes to the description by reading config files,
by contacting any configured credential helpers, or by prompting the
user. The username and password attributes of the credential
description are then printed to stdout together with the attributes
already provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the action is <code>approve</code>, git-credential will send the description
to any configured credential helpers, which may store the credential
for later use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the action is <code>reject</code>, git-credential will send the description to
any configured credential helpers, which may erase any stored
credentials matching the description.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the action is <code>capability</code>, git-credential will announce any capabilities
it supports to standard output.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the action is <code>approve</code> or <code>reject</code>, no output should be emitted.</p>

<h2 id="_typical_use_of_git_credential"><a class="anchor" href="#_typical_use_of_git_credential"></a>TYPICAL USE OF GIT CREDENTIAL</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An application using git-credential will typically use <code>git
credential</code> following these steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Generate a credential description based on the context.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if we want a password for
<code>https://example.com/foo.git</code>, we might generate the following
credential description (don&#8217;t forget the blank line at the end; it
tells <code>git credential</code> that the application finished feeding all the
information it has):</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>protocol=https
host=example.com
path=foo.git</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask git-credential to give us a username and password for this
description. This is done by running <code>git credential fill</code>,
feeding the description from step (1) to its standard input. The complete
credential description (including the credential per se, i.e. the
login and password) will be produced on standard output, like:</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>protocol=https
host=example.com
username=bob
password=secr3t</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, this means the attributes given in the input will be
repeated in the output, but Git may also modify the credential
description, for example by removing the <code>path</code> attribute when the
protocol is HTTP(s) and <code>credential.useHttpPath</code> is false.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the <code>git credential</code> knew about the password, this step may
not have involved the user actually typing this password (the
user may have typed a password to unlock the keychain instead,
or no user interaction was done if the keychain was already
unlocked) before it returned <code>password=secr3t</code>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the credential (e.g., access the URL with the username and
password from step (2)), and see if it&#8217;s accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report on the success or failure of the password. If the
credential allowed the operation to complete successfully, then
it can be marked with an "approve" action to tell <code>git
credential</code> to reuse it in its next invocation. If the credential
was rejected during the operation, use the "reject" action so
that <code>git credential</code> will ask for a new password in its next
invocation. In either case, <code>git credential</code> should be fed with
the credential description obtained from step (2) (which also
contains the fields provided in step (1)).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="IOFMT"><a class="anchor" href="#IOFMT"></a>INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git credential</code> reads and/or writes (depending on the action used)
credential information in its standard input/output. This information
can correspond either to keys for which <code>git credential</code> will obtain
the login information (e.g. host, protocol, path), or to the actual
credential data to be obtained (username/password).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The credential is split into a set of named attributes, with one
attribute per line. Each attribute is specified by a key-value pair,
separated by an <code>=</code> (equals) sign, followed by a newline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key may contain any bytes except <code>=</code>, newline, or NUL. The value may
contain any bytes except newline or NUL.  A line, including the trailing
newline, may not exceed 65535 bytes in order to allow implementations to
parse efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attributes with keys that end with C-style array brackets <code>[]</code> can have
multiple values. Each instance of a multi-valued attribute forms an
ordered list of values - the order of the repeated attributes defines
the order of the values. An empty multi-valued attribute (<code>key[]=\n</code>)
acts to clear any previous entries and reset the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all cases, all bytes are treated as-is (i.e., there is no quoting,
and one cannot transmit a value with newline or NUL in it). The list of
attributes is terminated by a blank line or end-of-file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git understands the following attributes:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeprotocolcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeprotocolcode"></a><code>protocol</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>The protocol over which the credential will be used (e.g.,
<code>https</code>).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codehostcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codehostcode"></a><code>host</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>The remote hostname for a network credential.  This includes
the port number if one was specified (e.g., "example.com:8088").</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codepathcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codepathcode"></a><code>path</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>The path with which the credential will be used. E.g., for
accessing a remote https repository, this will be the
repository&#8217;s path on the server.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeusernamecode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeusernamecode"></a><code>username</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>The credential&#8217;s username, if we already have one (e.g., from a
URL, the configuration, the user, or from a previously run helper).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codepasswordcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codepasswordcode"></a><code>password</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>The credential&#8217;s password, if we are asking it to be stored.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codepasswordexpiryutccode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codepasswordexpiryutccode"></a><code>password_expiry_utc</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>Generated passwords such as an OAuth access token may have an expiry date.
When reading credentials from helpers, <code>git credential fill</code> ignores expired
passwords. Represented as Unix time UTC, seconds since 1970.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeoauthrefreshtokencode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeoauthrefreshtokencode"></a><code>oauth_refresh_token</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>An OAuth refresh token may accompany a password that is an OAuth access
token. Helpers must treat this attribute as confidential like the password
attribute. Git itself has no special behaviour for this attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeurlcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeurlcode"></a><code>url</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>When this special attribute is read by <code>git credential</code>, the
value is parsed as a URL and treated as if its constituent parts
were read (e.g., <code>url=https://example.com</code> would behave as if
<code>protocol=https</code> and <code>host=example.com</code> had been provided). This
can help callers avoid parsing URLs themselves.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that specifying a protocol is mandatory and if the URL
doesn&#8217;t specify a hostname (e.g., "cert:///path/to/file") the
credential will contain a hostname attribute whose value is an
empty string.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Components which are missing from the URL (e.g., there is no
username in the example above) will be left unset.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeauthtypecode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeauthtypecode"></a><code>authtype</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates that the authentication scheme in question should be used.
Common values for HTTP and HTTPS include <code>basic</code>, <code>bearer</code>, and <code>digest</code>,
although the latter is insecure and should not be used.  If <code>credential</code>
is used, this may be set to an arbitrary string suitable for the protocol in
question (usually HTTP).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is
provided on input.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codecredentialcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codecredentialcode"></a><code>credential</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>The pre-encoded credential, suitable for the protocol in question (usually
HTTP).  If this key is sent, <code>authtype</code> is mandatory, and <code>username</code> and
<code>password</code> are not used.  For HTTP, Git concatenates the <code>authtype</code> value and
this value with a single space to determine the <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is
provided on input.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeephemeralcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codeephemeralcode"></a><code>ephemeral</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>This boolean value indicates, if true, that the value in the <code>credential</code>
field should not be saved by the credential helper because its usefulness is
limited in time.  For example, an HTTP Digest <code>credential</code> value is computed
using a nonce and reusing it will not result in successful authentication.
This may also be used for situations with short duration (e.g., 24-hour)
credentials.  The default value is false.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The credential helper will still be invoked with <code>store</code> or <code>erase</code> so that it
can determine whether the operation was successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is
provided on input.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codestatecode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codestatecode"></a><code>state[]</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>This value provides an opaque state that will be passed back to this helper
if it is called again.  Each different credential helper may specify this
once.  The value should include a prefix unique to the credential helper and
should ignore values that don&#8217;t match its prefix.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is
provided on input.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codecontinuecode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codecontinuecode"></a><code>continue</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a boolean value, which, if enabled, indicates that this
authentication is a non-final part of a multistage authentication step. This
is common in protocols such as NTLM and Kerberos, where two rounds of client
authentication are required, and setting this flag allows the credential
helper to implement the multistage authentication step.  This flag should
only be sent if a further stage is required; that is, if another round of
authentication is expected.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is
provided on input.  This attribute is <em>one-way</em> from a credential helper to
pass information to Git (or other programs invoking <code>git credential</code>).</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codewwwauthcode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codewwwauthcode"></a><code>wwwauth[]</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>When an HTTP response is received by Git that includes one or more
<em>WWW-Authenticate</em> authentication headers, these will be passed by Git
to credential helpers.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each <em>WWW-Authenticate</em> header value is passed as a multi-valued
attribute <em>wwwauth[]</em>, where the order of the attributes is the same as
they appear in the HTTP response. This attribute is <em>one-way</em> from Git
to pass additional information to credential helpers.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-codecapabilitycode"> <a class="anchor" href="#Documentation/git-credential.txt-codecapabilitycode"></a><code>capability[]</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>This signals that Git, or the helper, as appropriate, supports the capability
in question.  This can be used to provide better, more specific data as part
of the protocol.  A <code>capability[]</code> directive must precede any value depending
on it and these directives <em>should</em> be the first item announced in the
protocol.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two currently supported capabilities.  The first is <code>authtype</code>, which
indicates that the <code>authtype</code>, <code>credential</code>, and <code>ephemeral</code> values are
understood.  The second is <code>state</code>, which indicates that the <code>state[]</code> and
<code>continue</code> values are understood.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not obligatory to use the additional features just because the capability
is supported, but they should not be provided without the capability.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unrecognised attributes and capabilities are silently discarded.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="CAPA-IOFMT"><a class="anchor" href="#CAPA-IOFMT"></a>CAPABILITY INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For <code>git credential capability</code>, the format is slightly different. First, a
<code>version 0</code> announcement is made to indicate the current version of the
protocol, and then each capability is announced with a line like <code>capability
authtype</code>. Credential helpers may also implement this format, again with the
<code>capability</code> argument. Additional lines may be added in the future; callers
should ignore lines which they don&#8217;t understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because this is a new part of the credential helper protocol, older versions of
Git, as well as some credential helpers, may not support it.  If a non-zero
exit status is received, or if the first line doesn&#8217;t start with the word
<code>version</code> and a space, callers should assume that no capabilities are supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The intention of this format is to differentiate it from the credential output
in an unambiguous way.  It is possible to use very simple credential helpers
(e.g., inline shell scripts) which always produce identical output.  Using a
distinct format allows users to continue to use this syntax without having to
worry about correctly implementing capability advertisements or accidentally
confusing callers querying for capabilities.</p>
