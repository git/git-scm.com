<div class="paragraph">
<p>Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects
necessary to complete the given refs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can make interesting things happen to a repository
every time you push into it, by setting up <em>hooks</em> there.  See
documentation for <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-receive-pack" >}}'>git-receive-pack[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the command line does not specify where to push with the
<code>&lt;repository&gt;</code> argument, <code>branch.*.remote</code> configuration for the
current branch is consulted to determine where to push.  If the
configuration is missing, it defaults to <em>origin</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the command line does not specify what to push with <code>&lt;refspec&gt;...</code>
arguments or <code>--all</code>, <code>--mirror</code>, <code>--tags</code> options, the command finds
the default <code>&lt;refspec&gt;</code> by consulting <code>remote.*.push</code> configuration,
and if it is not found, honors <code>push.default</code> configuration to decide
what to push (See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a> for the meaning of <code>push.default</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When neither the command-line nor the configuration specifies what to
push, the default behavior is used, which corresponds to the <code>simple</code>
value for <code>push.default</code>: the current branch is pushed to the
corresponding upstream branch, but as a safety measure, the push is
aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same name as the
local one.</p>

<p>The "remote" repository that is the destination of a push
operation.  This parameter can be either a URL
(see the section <a href="#URLS">GIT URLS</a> below) or the name
of a remote (see the section <a href="#REMOTES">REMOTES</a> below).</p>

<dd>
<p>Specify what destination ref to update with what source object.
The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus
<code>+</code>, followed by the source object &lt;src&gt;, followed
by a colon <code>:</code>, followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &lt;src&gt; is often the name of the branch you would want to push, but
it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression", such as <code>master~4</code> or
<code>HEAD</code> (see <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitrevisions" >}}'>gitrevisions[7]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &lt;dst&gt; tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this
push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an actual ref must
be named.
If <code>git push [&lt;repository&gt;]</code> without any <code>&lt;refspec&gt;</code> argument is set to
update some ref at the destination with <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> with
<code>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.push</code> configuration variable, <code>:&lt;dst&gt;</code> part can
be omitted&#8212;&#8203;such a push will update a ref that <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> normally updates
without any <code>&lt;refspec&gt;</code> on the command line.  Otherwise, missing
<code>:&lt;dst&gt;</code> means to update the same ref as the <code>&lt;src&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If &lt;dst&gt; doesn&#8217;t start with <code>refs/</code> (e.g. <code>refs/heads/master</code>) we will
try to infer where in <code>refs/*</code> on the destination &lt;repository&gt; it
belongs based on the type of &lt;src&gt; being pushed and whether &lt;dst&gt;
is ambiguous.</p>
</div>
<div class="openblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If &lt;dst&gt; unambiguously refers to a ref on the &lt;repository&gt; remote,
then push to that ref.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If &lt;src&gt; resolves to a ref starting with refs/heads/ or refs/tags/,
then prepend that to &lt;dst&gt;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other ambiguity resolutions might be added in the future, but for
now any other cases will error out with an error indicating what we
tried, and depending on the <code>advice.pushUnqualifiedRefname</code>
configuration (see <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a>) suggest what refs/
namespace you may have wanted to push to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The object referenced by &lt;src&gt; is used to update the &lt;dst&gt; reference
on the remote side. Whether this is allowed depends on where in
<code>refs/*</code> the &lt;dst&gt; reference lives as described in detail below, in
those sections "update" means any modifications except deletes, which
as noted after the next few sections are treated differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>refs/heads/*</code> namespace will only accept commit objects, and
updates only if they can be fast-forwarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>refs/tags/*</code> namespace will accept any kind of object (as
commits, trees and blobs can be tagged), and any updates to them will
be rejected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s possible to push any type of object to any namespace outside of
<code>refs/{tags,heads}/*</code>. In the case of tags and commits, these will be
treated as if they were the commits inside <code>refs/heads/*</code> for the
purposes of whether the update is allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I.e. a fast-forward of commits and tags outside <code>refs/{tags,heads}/*</code>
is allowed, even in cases where what&#8217;s being fast-forwarded is not a
commit, but a tag object which happens to point to a new commit which
is a fast-forward of the commit the last tag (or commit) it&#8217;s
replacing. Replacing a tag with an entirely different tag is also
allowed, if it points to the same commit, as well as pushing a peeled
tag, i.e. pushing the commit that existing tag object points to, or a
new tag object which an existing commit points to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tree and blob objects outside of <code>refs/{tags,heads}/*</code> will be treated
the same way as if they were inside <code>refs/tags/*</code>, any update of them
will be rejected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of the rules described above about what&#8217;s not allowed as an update
can be overridden by adding an the optional leading <code>+</code> to a refspec
(or using <code>--force</code> command line option). The only exception to this
is that no amount of forcing will make the <code>refs/heads/*</code> namespace
accept a non-commit object. Hooks and configuration can also override
or amend these rules, see e.g. <code>receive.denyNonFastForwards</code> in
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a> and <code>pre-receive</code> and <code>update</code> in
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/githooks" >}}'>githooks[5]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pushing an empty &lt;src&gt; allows you to delete the &lt;dst&gt; ref from the
remote repository. Deletions are always accepted without a leading <code>+</code>
in the refspec (or <code>--force</code>), except when forbidden by configuration
or hooks. See <code>receive.denyDeletes</code> in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a> and
<code>pre-receive</code> and <code>update</code> in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/githooks" >}}'>githooks[5]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The special refspec <code>:</code> (or <code>+:</code> to allow non-fast-forward updates)
directs Git to push "matching" branches: for every branch that exists on
the local side, the remote side is updated if a branch of the same name
already exists on the remote side.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>tag &lt;tag&gt;</code> means the same as <code>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</code>.</p>

a remote branch <code>tmp</code> will be removed if a local branch with the same

<p>Usually, "git push" refuses to update a remote ref that is
not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the
remote ref is the expected value.  "git push" fails otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published.
You will have to bypass the "must fast-forward" rule in order to
replace the history you originally published with the rebased history.
If somebody else built on top of your original history while you are
rebasing, the tip of the branch at the remote may advance with their
commit, and blindly pushing with <code>--force</code> will lose their work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are
updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the remote ref
still points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no
other people did anything to the ref. It is like taking a "lease" on
the ref without explicitly locking it, and the remote ref is updated
only if the "lease" is still valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>--force-with-lease</code> alone, without specifying the details, will protect
all remote refs that are going to be updated by requiring their
current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we have
for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</code>, without specifying the expected value, will
protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be updated, by
requiring its current value to be the same as the remote-tracking
branch we have for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</code> will protect the named ref (alone),
if it is going to be updated, by requiring its current value to be
the same as the specified value <code>&lt;expect&gt;</code> (which is allowed to be
different from the remote-tracking branch we have for the refname,
or we do not even have to have such a remote-tracking branch when
this form is used).  If <code>&lt;expect&gt;</code> is the empty string, then the named ref
must not already exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that all forms other than <code>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</code>
that specifies the expected current value of the ref explicitly are
still experimental and their semantics may change as we gain experience
with this feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"--no-force-with-lease" will cancel all the previous --force-with-lease on the
command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A general note on safety: supplying this option without an expected
value, i.e. as <code>--force-with-lease</code> or <code>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</code>
interacts very badly with anything that implicitly runs <code>git fetch</code> on
the remote to be pushed to in the background, e.g. <code>git fetch origin</code>
on your repository in a cronjob.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The protection it offers over <code>--force</code> is ensuring that subsequent
changes your work wasn&#8217;t based on aren&#8217;t clobbered, but this is
trivially defeated if some background process is updating refs in the
background. We don&#8217;t have anything except the remote tracking info to
go by as a heuristic for refs you&#8217;re expected to have seen &amp; are
willing to clobber.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your editor or some other system is running <code>git fetch</code> in the
background for you a way to mitigate this is to simply set up another
remote:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git remote add origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url)
git fetch origin-push</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now when the background process runs <code>git fetch origin</code> the references
on <code>origin-push</code> won&#8217;t be updated, and thus commands like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git push --force-with-lease origin-push</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Will fail unless you manually run <code>git fetch origin-push</code>. This method
is of course entirely defeated by something that runs <code>git fetch
--all</code>, in that case you&#8217;d need to either disable it or do something
more tedious like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git fetch              # update 'master' from remote
git tag base master    # mark our base point
git rebase -i master   # rewrite some commits
git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I.e. create a <code>base</code> tag for versions of the upstream code that you&#8217;ve
seen and are willing to overwrite, then rewrite history, and finally
force push changes to <code>master</code> if the remote version is still at
<code>base</code>, regardless of what your local <code>remotes/origin/master</code> has been
updated to in the background.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, specifying <code>--force-if-includes</code> as an ancillary option
along with <code>--force-with-lease[=&lt;refname&gt;]</code> (i.e., without saying what
exact commit the ref on the remote side must be pointing at, or which
refs on the remote side are being protected) at the time of "push" will
verify if updates from the remote-tracking refs that may have been
implicitly updated in the background are integrated locally before
allowing a forced update.</p>

<dd>
<p>Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is
not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.
Also, when <code>--force-with-lease</code> option is used, the command refuses
to update a remote ref whose current value does not match
what is expected.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This flag disables these checks, and can cause the remote repository
to lose commits; use it with care.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that <code>--force</code> applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence
using it with <code>push.default</code> set to <code>matching</code> or with multiple push
destinations configured with <code>remote.*.push</code> may overwrite refs
other than the current branch (including local refs that are
strictly behind their remote counterpart).  To force a push to only
one branch, use a <code>+</code> in front of the refspec to push (e.g <code>git push
origin +master</code> to force a push to the <code>master</code> branch). See the
<code>&lt;refspec&gt;...</code> section above for details.</p>

<p>This option enables a check that verifies if the tip of the

the local branch based in it for a rewrite. The check ensures that any

forced update if that is not the case.</p>

If <em>check</em> is used Git will verify that all submodule commits that
changed in the revisions to be pushed are available on at least one
remote of the submodule. If any commits are missing the push will
be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If <em>on-demand</em> is used
all submodules that changed in the revisions to be pushed will be
pushed. If on-demand was not able to push all necessary revisions it will
also be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If <em>only</em> is used all

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository.
Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be
absent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp
and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and
deprecated; do not use them).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
should be used with caution on unsecured networks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following syntaxes may be used with them:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ssh://</code>[<em>&lt;user&gt;</em><code>@</code>]<em>&lt;host&gt;</em>[<code>:</code><em>&lt;port&gt;</em>]<code>/</code><em>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git://</code><em>&lt;host&gt;</em>[:<em>&lt;port&gt;</em>]<code>/</code><em>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</em></p>

<li>
<p><code>http</code>[<code>s</code>]<code>://</code><em>&lt;host&gt;</em>[<code>:</code><em>&lt;port&gt;</em>]<code>/</code><em>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ftp</code>[<code>s</code>]<code>://</code><em>&lt;host&gt;</em>[<code>:</code><em>&lt;port&gt;</em>]<code>/</code><em>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>[<em>&lt;user&gt;</em><code>@</code>]<em>&lt;host&gt;</em><code>:/</code><em>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a
colon. For example the local path <code>foo:bar</code> could be specified as an
absolute path or <code>./foo:bar</code> to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh
url.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ssh and git protocols additionally support <code>~</code><em>&lt;username&gt;</em> expansion:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ssh://</code>[<em>&lt;user&gt;</em><code>@</code>]<em>&lt;host&gt;</em>[<code>:</code><em>&lt;port&gt;</em>]<code>/~</code><em>&lt;user&gt;</em><code>/</code><em>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</em></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/path/to/repo.git/</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code><a href="file:///path/to/repo.git/" class="bare">file:///path/to/repo.git/</a></code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when
the former implies <code>--local</code> option. See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-clone" >}}'>git-clone[1]</a> for
details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git clone</code>, <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git pull</code>, but not <code>git push</code>, will also
accept a suitable bundle file. See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-bundle" >}}'>git-bundle[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Git doesn&#8217;t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the <code>remote-</code><em>&lt;transport&gt;</em> remote helper, if one
exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax
may be used:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>&lt;transport&gt;</em>::<em>&lt;address&gt;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <em>&lt;address&gt;</em> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
invoked. See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitremote-helpers" >}}'>gitremote-helpers[7]</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you
use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a
configuration section of the form:</p>
</div>
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">	[url "<em>&lt;actual-url-base&gt;</em>"]
		insteadOf = <em>&lt;other-url-base&gt;</em></pre>

</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	[url "git://git.host.xz/"]
		insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
		insteadOf = work:</pre>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:</p>
</div>
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">	[url "<em>&lt;actual-url-base&gt;</em>"]
		pushInsteadOf = <em>&lt;other-url-base&gt;</em></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to

<h2 id="_note_about_fast_forwards"><a class="anchor" href="#_note_about_fast_forwards"></a>NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used to
point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the original
commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the new commit B
builds on top of.  Hence, it does not lose any history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history.  For example,
suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X, and you built
a history leading to commit B while the other person built a history
leading to commit A.  The history looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>      B
     /
 ---X---A</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes leading to A
back to the original repository from which you two obtained the original
commit X.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to point at
commit X to point at commit A.  It is a fast-forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that
now points at A) with commit B.  This does <em>not</em> fast-forward.  If you did
so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because everybody
will now start building on top of B.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command by default does not allow an update that is not a fast-forward
to prevent such loss of history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the work by
the other person (history from X to A), you would need to first fetch the
history from the repository, create a history that contains changes done
by both parties, and push the result back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can perform "git pull", resolve potential conflicts, and "git push"
the result.  A "git pull" will create a merge commit C between commits A
and B.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>      B---C
     /   /
 ---X---A</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your
push will be accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A,
with "git pull --rebase", and push the result back.  The rebase will
create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on top of
A.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>      B   D
     /   /
 ---X---A</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will be
accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another common situation where you may encounter non-fast-forward
rejection when you try to push, and it is possible even when you are
pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After you push commit
A yourself (in the first picture in this section), replace it with "git
commit --amend" to produce commit B, and you try to push it out, because
forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a case, and only if
you are certain that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier commit A
(and started building on top of it), you can run "git push --force" to
overwrite it. In other words, "git push --force" is a method reserved for
a case where you do mean to lose history.</p>

<p>The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from
stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious
peer, your best option is to store it in another repository. This applies
to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a server are not
effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a
namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire
repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The known attack vectors are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that
are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to optimize the
transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object ID X
to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn&#8217;t required to send the content of
X because the victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the
attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker
later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a
server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has access
to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it
on a client is to "merge" X into a public branch and hope that the user
does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
without noticing the merge.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends
an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker falsely
claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X.
The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.</p>

given (whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere).
Different values are well-suited for
specific workflows; for instance, in a purely central workflow
(i.e. the fetch source is equal to the push destination),
<code>upstream</code> is probably what you want.  Possible values are:</p>
<div class="openblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>nothing</code> - do not push anything (error out) unless a refspec is
given. This is primarily meant for people who want to
avoid mistakes by always being explicit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>current</code> - push the current branch to update a branch with the same
name on the receiving end.  Works in both central and non-central
workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>upstream</code> - push the current branch back to the branch whose
changes are usually integrated into the current branch (which is
called <code>@{upstream}</code>).  This mode only makes sense if you are
pushing to the same repository you would normally pull from
(i.e. central workflow).</p>

<li>
<p><code>tracking</code> - This is a deprecated synonym for <code>upstream</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>simple</code> - push the current branch with the same name on the remote.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the same repository you
pull from, which is typically <code>origin</code>), then you need to configure an upstream
branch with the same name.</p>

<p>This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option suited for
beginners.</p>

<p><code>matching</code> - push all branches having the same name on both ends.
This makes the repository you are pushing to remember the set of
branches that will be pushed out (e.g. if you always push <em>maint</em>
and <em>master</em> there and no other branches, the repository you push
to will have these two branches, and your local <em>maint</em> and
<em>master</em> will be pushed there).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure <em>all</em> the
branches you would push out are ready to be pushed out before
running <em>git push</em>, as the whole point of this mode is to allow you
to push all of the branches in one go.  If you usually finish work
on only one branch and push out the result, while other branches are
unfinished, this mode is not for you.  Also this mode is not
suitable for pushing into a shared central repository, as other
people may add new branches there, or update the tip of existing
branches outside your control.</p>
