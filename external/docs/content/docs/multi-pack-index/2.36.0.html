<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Git object directory contains a <em>pack</em> directory containing
packfiles (with suffix ".pack") and pack-indexes (with suffix
".idx"). The pack-indexes provide a way to lookup objects and
navigate to their offset within the pack, but these must come
in pairs with the packfiles. This pairing depends on the file
names, as the pack-index differs only in suffix with its pack-
file. While the pack-indexes provide fast lookup per packfile,
this performance degrades as the number of packfiles increases,
because abbreviations need to inspect every packfile and we are
more likely to have a miss on our most-recently-used packfile.
For some large repositories, repacking into a single packfile
is not feasible due to storage space or excessive repack times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The multi-pack-index (MIDX for short) stores a list of objects
and their offsets into multiple packfiles. It contains:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A list of packfile names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sorted list of object IDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of metadata for the ith object ID including:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A value j referring to the jth packfile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offset within the jth packfile for the object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If large offsets are required, we use another list of large
offsets similar to version 2 pack-indexes.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An optional list of objects in pseudo-pack order (used with MIDX bitmaps).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, we can provide O(log N) lookup time for any number
of packfiles.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The MIDX is stored in a file named <em>multi-pack-index</em> in the
.git/objects/pack directory. This could be stored in the pack
directory of an alternate. It refers only to packfiles in that
same directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core.multiPackIndex config setting must be on (which is the
default) to consume MIDX files.  Setting it to <code>false</code> prevents
Git from reading a MIDX file, even if one exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The file format includes parameters for the object ID hash
function, so a future change of hash algorithm does not require
a change in format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MIDX keeps only one record per object ID. If an object appears
in multiple packfiles, then the MIDX selects the copy in the
preferred packfile, otherwise selecting from the most-recently
modified packfile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there exist packfiles in the pack directory not registered in
the MIDX, then those packfiles are loaded into the <code>packed_git</code>
list and <code>packed_git_mru</code> cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pack-indexes (.idx files) remain in the pack directory so we
can delete the MIDX file, set core.midx to false, or downgrade
without any loss of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MIDX file format uses a chunk-based approach (similar to the
commit-graph file) that allows optional data to be added.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The multi-pack-index allows many packfiles, especially in a context
where repacking is expensive (such as a very large repo), or
unexpected maintenance time is unacceptable (such as a high-demand
build machine). However, the multi-pack-index needs to be rewritten
in full every time. We can extend the format to be incremental, so
writes are fast. By storing a small "tip" multi-pack-index that
points to large "base" MIDX files, we can keep writes fast while
still reducing the number of binary searches required for object
lookups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the multi-pack-index is extended to store a "stable object order"
(a function Order(hash) = integer that is constant for a given hash,
even as the multi-pack-index is updated) then MIDX bitmaps could be
updated independently of the MIDX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packfiles can be marked as "special" using empty files that share
the initial name but replace ".pack" with ".keep" or ".promisor".
We can add an optional chunk of data to the multi-pack-index that
records flags of information about the packfiles. This allows new
states, such as <em>repacked</em> or <em>redeltified</em>, that can help with
pack maintenance in a multi-pack environment. It may also be
helpful to organize packfiles by object type (commit, tree, blob,
etc.) and use this metadata to help that maintenance.</p>
