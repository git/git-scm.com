<div class="paragraph">
<p>It will be useful to have a Git repository to experiment with as you
read this manual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best way to get one is by using the <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-clone" >}}'>git-clone[1]</a> command to
download a copy of an existing repository.  If you don&#8217;t already have a
project in mind, here are some interesting examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	# Git itself (approx. 40MB download):
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
	# the Linux kernel (approx. 640MB download):
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initial clone may be time-consuming for a large project, but you
will only need to clone once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The clone command creates a new directory named after the project
(<code>git</code> or <code>linux</code> in the examples above).  After you cd into this
directory, you will see that it contains a copy of the project files,
called the <a href="#def_working_tree">working tree</a>, together with a special
top-level directory named <code>.git</code>, which contains all the information
about the history of the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="how-to-check-out"><a class="anchor" href="#how-to-check-out"></a>How to check out a different version of a project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git is best thought of as a tool for storing the history of a collection
of files.  It stores the history as a compressed collection of
interrelated snapshots of the project&#8217;s contents.  In Git each such
version is called a <a href="#def_commit">commit</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those snapshots aren&#8217;t necessarily all arranged in a single line from
oldest to newest; instead, work may simultaneously proceed along
parallel lines of development, called <a href="#def_branch">branches</a>, which may
merge and diverge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A single Git repository can track development on multiple branches.  It
does this by keeping a list of <a href="#def_head">heads</a> which reference the
latest commit on each branch; the <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-branch" >}}'>git-branch[1]</a> command shows
you the list of branch heads:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git branch
* master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A freshly cloned repository contains a single branch head, by default
named "master", with the working directory initialized to the state of
the project referred to by that branch head.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most projects also use <a href="#def_tag">tags</a>.  Tags, like heads, are
references into the project&#8217;s history, and can be listed using the
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-tag" >}}'>git-tag[1]</a> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git tag -l
v2.6.11
v2.6.11-tree
v2.6.12
v2.6.12-rc2
v2.6.12-rc3
v2.6.12-rc4
v2.6.12-rc5
v2.6.12-rc6
v2.6.13
...</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tags are expected to always point at the same version of a project,
while heads are expected to advance as development progresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Create a new branch head pointing to one of these versions and check it
out using <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-switch" >}}'>git-switch[1]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git switch -c new v2.6.13</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The working directory then reflects the contents that the project had
when it was tagged v2.6.13, and <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-branch" >}}'>git-branch[1]</a> shows two
branches, with an asterisk marking the currently checked-out branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git branch
  master
* new</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you decide that you&#8217;d rather see version 2.6.17, you can modify
the current branch to point at v2.6.17 instead, with</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git reset --hard v2.6.17</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that if the current branch head was your only reference to a
particular point in history, then resetting that branch may leave you
with no way to find the history it used to point to; so use this command
carefully.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, a commit shows who made the latest change, what they
did, and why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every commit has a 40-hexdigit id, sometimes called the "object name" or the
"SHA-1 id", shown on the first line of the <code>git show</code> output.  You can usually
refer to a commit by a shorter name, such as a tag or a branch name, but this
longer name can also be useful.  Most importantly, it is a globally unique
name for this commit: so if you tell somebody else the object name (for
example in email), then you are guaranteed that name will refer to the same
commit in their repository that it does in yours (assuming their repository
has that commit at all).  Since the object name is computed as a hash over the
contents of the commit, you are guaranteed that the commit can never change
without its name also changing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, in <a href="#git-concepts">Git concepts</a> we shall see that everything stored in Git
history, including file data and directory contents, is stored in an object
with a name that is a hash of its contents.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="understanding-reachability"><a class="anchor" href="#understanding-reachability"></a>Understanding history: commits, parents, and reachability</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every commit (except the very first commit in a project) also has a
parent commit which shows what happened before this commit.
Following the chain of parents will eventually take you back to the
beginning of the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the commits do not form a simple list; Git allows lines of
development to diverge and then reconverge, and the point where two
lines of development reconverge is called a "merge".  The commit
representing a merge can therefore have more than one parent, with
each parent representing the most recent commit on one of the lines
of development leading to that point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best way to see how this works is using the <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitk" >}}'>gitk[1]</a>
command; running gitk now on a Git repository and looking for merge
commits will help understand how Git organizes history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following, we say that commit X is "reachable" from commit Y
if commit X is an ancestor of commit Y.  Equivalently, you could say
that Y is a descendant of X, or that there is a chain of parents
leading from commit Y to commit X.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="history-diagrams"><a class="anchor" href="#history-diagrams"></a>Understanding history: History diagrams</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will sometimes represent Git history using diagrams like the one
below.  Commits are shown as "o", and the links between them with
lines drawn with - / and \.  Time goes left to right:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>         o--o--o &lt;-- Branch A
        /
 o--o--o &lt;-- master
        \
         o--o--o &lt;-- Branch B</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we need to talk about a particular commit, the character "o" may
be replaced with another letter or number.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="what-is-a-branch"><a class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-branch"></a>Understanding history: What is a branch?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we need to be precise, we will use the word "branch" to mean a line
of development, and "branch head" (or just "head") to mean a reference
to the most recent commit on a branch.  In the example above, the branch
head named "A" is a pointer to one particular commit, but we refer to
the line of three commits leading up to that point as all being part of
"branch A".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when no confusion will result, we often just use the term
"branch" both for branches and for branch heads.</p>

check it out.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The special symbol "HEAD" can always be used to refer to the current
branch.  In fact, Git uses a file named <code>HEAD</code> in the <code>.git</code> directory
to remember which branch is current:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="detached-head"><a class="anchor" href="#detached-head"></a>Examining an old version without creating a new branch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git switch</code> command normally expects a branch head, but will also
accept an arbitrary commit when invoked with --detach; for example,
you can check out the commit referenced by a tag:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git switch --detach v2.6.17
Note: checking out 'v2.6.17'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another switch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command again. Example:

  git switch -c new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 427abfa Linux v2.6.17</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The HEAD then refers to the SHA-1 of the commit instead of to a branch,
and git branch shows that you are no longer on a branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ cat .git/HEAD
427abfa28afedffadfca9dd8b067eb6d36bac53f
$ git branch
* (detached from v2.6.17)
  master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case we say that the HEAD is "detached".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an easy way to check out a particular version without having to
make up a name for the new branch.   You can still create a new branch
(or tag) for this version later if you decide to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="examining-remote-branches"><a class="anchor" href="#examining-remote-branches"></a>Examining branches from a remote repository</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "master" branch that was created at the time you cloned is a copy
of the HEAD in the repository that you cloned from.  That repository
may also have had other branches, though, and your local repository
keeps branches which track each of those remote branches, called
remote-tracking branches, which you
can view using the <code>-r</code> option to <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-branch" >}}'>git-branch[1]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD
  origin/html
  origin/maint
  origin/man
  origin/master
  origin/next
  origin/seen
  origin/todo</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, "origin" is called a remote repository, or "remote"
for short. The branches of this repository are called "remote
branches" from our point of view. The remote-tracking branches listed
above were created based on the remote branches at clone time and will
be updated by <code>git fetch</code> (hence <code>git pull</code>) and <code>git push</code>. See
<a href="#Updating-a-repository-With-git-fetch">Updating a repository with git fetch</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might want to build on one of these remote-tracking branches
on a branch of your own, just as you would for a tag:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git switch -c my-todo-copy origin/todo</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also check out <code>origin/todo</code> directly to examine it or
write a one-off patch.  See <a href="#detached-head">detached head</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the name "origin" is just the name that Git uses by default
to refer to the repository that you cloned from.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="how-git-stores-references"><a class="anchor" href="#how-git-stores-references"></a>Naming branches, tags, and other references</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Branches, remote-tracking branches, and tags are all references to
commits.  All references are named with a slash-separated path name
starting with <code>refs</code>; the names we&#8217;ve been using so far are actually
shorthand:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The branch <code>test</code> is short for <code>refs/heads/test</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tag <code>v2.6.18</code> is short for <code>refs/tags/v2.6.18</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>origin/master</code> is short for <code>refs/remotes/origin/master</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The full name is occasionally useful if, for example, there ever
exists a tag and a branch with the same name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Newly created refs are actually stored in the <code>.git/refs</code> directory,
under the path given by their name.  However, for efficiency reasons
they may also be packed together in a single file; see
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-pack-refs" >}}'>git-pack-refs[1]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As another useful shortcut, the "HEAD" of a repository can be referred
to just using the name of that repository.  So, for example, "origin"
is usually a shortcut for the HEAD branch in the repository "origin".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the complete list of paths which Git checks for references, and
the order it uses to decide which to choose when there are multiple
references with the same shorthand name, see the "SPECIFYING

<p>The <code>git-fetch</code> command, with no arguments, will update all of the
remote-tracking branches to the latest version found in the original

"master" crashes.  Sometimes the best way to find the cause of such a
regression is to perform a brute-force search through the project&#8217;s
history to find the particular commit that caused the problem.  The
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-bisect" >}}'>git-bisect[1]</a> command can help you do this:</p>

<h3 id="naming-commits"><a class="anchor" href="#naming-commits"></a>Naming commits</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have seen several ways of naming commits already:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>40-hexdigit object name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>branch name: refers to the commit at the head of the given
branch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tag name: refers to the commit pointed to by the given tag
(we&#8217;ve seen branches and tags are special cases of
<a href="#how-git-stores-references">references</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HEAD: refers to the head of the current branch</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many more; see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section of the
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitrevisions" >}}'>gitrevisions[7]</a> man page for the complete list of ways to
name revisions.  Some examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git show fb47ddb2 # the first few characters of the object name
		    # are usually enough to specify it uniquely
$ git show HEAD^    # the parent of the HEAD commit
$ git show HEAD^^   # the grandparent
$ git show HEAD~4   # the great-great-grandparent</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that merge commits may have more than one parent; by default,
<code>^</code> and <code>~</code> follow the first parent listed in the commit, but you can
also choose:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git show HEAD^1   # show the first parent of HEAD
$ git show HEAD^2   # show the second parent of HEAD</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to HEAD, there are several other special names for
commits:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merges (to be discussed later), as well as operations such as
<code>git reset</code>, which change the currently checked-out commit, generally
set ORIG_HEAD to the value HEAD had before the current operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git fetch</code> operation always stores the head of the last fetched
branch in FETCH_HEAD.  For example, if you run <code>git fetch</code> without
specifying a local branch as the target of the operation</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git theirbranch</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the fetched commits will still be available from FETCH_HEAD.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we discuss merges we&#8217;ll also see the special name MERGE_HEAD,
which refers to the other branch that we&#8217;re merging in to the current
branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-rev-parse" >}}'>git-rev-parse[1]</a> command is a low-level command that is
occasionally useful for translating some name for a commit to the object
name for that commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<h3 id="creating-tags"><a class="anchor" href="#creating-tags"></a>Creating tags</h3>

<p>You can use <code>stable-1</code> to refer to the commit 1b2e1d63ff.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This creates a "lightweight" tag.  If you would also like to include a

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-log" >}}'>git-log[1]</a> command can show lists of commits.  On its
own, it shows all commits reachable from the parent commit; but you
can also make more specific requests:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks
$ git log Makefile      # commits which modify Makefile
$ git log fs/		# ... which modify any file under fs/
$ git log -S'foo()'	# commits which add or remove any file data
			# matching the string 'foo()'</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And of course you can combine all of these; the following finds
commits since v2.5 which touch the <code>Makefile</code> or any file under <code>fs</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git log v2.5.. Makefile fs/</pre>

display options.</p>

<p>Note that git log starts with the most recent commit and works
backwards through the parents; however, since Git history can contain
multiple independent lines of development, the particular order that
commits are listed in may be somewhat arbitrary.</p>

<li>
<p>Making some changes to the working directory using your

in step 2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, you can interleave and repeat steps 1 and 2 as many
times as you want: in order to keep track of what you want committed
at step 3, Git maintains a snapshot of the tree&#8217;s contents in a
special staging area called "the index."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the beginning, the content of the index will be identical to
that of the HEAD.  The command <code>git diff --cached</code>, which shows
the difference between the HEAD and the index, should therefore
produce no output at that point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modifying the index is easy:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To update the index with the contents of a new or modified file, use</p>

<h3 id="creating-good-commit-messages"><a class="anchor" href="#creating-good-commit-messages"></a>Creating good commit messages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though not required, it&#8217;s a good idea to begin the commit message
with a single short (no more than 50 characters) line summarizing the
change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough
description.  The text up to the first blank line in a commit
message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used
throughout Git.  For example, <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-format-patch" >}}'>git-format-patch[1]</a> turns a
commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the
rest of the commit in the body.</p>

<h3 id="ignoring-files"><a class="anchor" href="#ignoring-files"></a>Ignoring files</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A project will often generate files that you do <em>not</em> want to track with Git.
This typically includes files generated by a build process or temporary
backup files made by your editor. Of course, <em>not</em> tracking files with Git
is just a matter of <em>not</em> calling <code>git add</code> on them. But it quickly becomes
annoying to have these untracked files lying around; e.g. they make
<code>git add .</code> practically useless, and they keep showing up in the output of
<code>git status</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can tell Git to ignore certain files by creating a file called
<code>.gitignore</code> in the top level of your working directory, with contents
such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre># Lines starting with '#' are considered comments.
# Ignore any file named foo.txt.
foo.txt
# Ignore (generated) html files,
*.html
# except foo.html which is maintained by hand.
!foo.html
# Ignore objects and archives.
*.[oa]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitignore" >}}'>gitignore[5]</a> for a detailed explanation of the syntax.  You can
also place .gitignore files in other directories in your working tree, and they
will apply to those directories and their subdirectories.  The <code>.gitignore</code>
files can be added to your repository like any other files (just run <code>git add
.gitignore</code> and <code>git commit</code>, as usual), which is convenient when the exclude
patterns (such as patterns matching build output files) would also make sense
for other users who clone your repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you wish the exclude patterns to affect only certain repositories
(instead of every repository for a given project), you may instead put
them in a file in your repository named <code>.git/info/exclude</code>, or in any
file specified by the <code>core.excludesFile</code> configuration variable.
Some Git commands can also take exclude patterns directly on the
command line.  See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitignore" >}}'>gitignore[5]</a> for the details.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-merge"><a class="anchor" href="#how-to-merge"></a>How to merge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can rejoin two diverging branches of development using
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-merge" >}}'>git-merge[1]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git merge branchname</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>merges the development in the branch <code>branchname</code> into the current
branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A merge is made by combining the changes made in <code>branchname</code> and the
changes made up to the latest commit in your current branch since
their histories forked. The work tree is overwritten by the result of
the merge when this combining is done cleanly, or overwritten by a
half-merged results when this combining results in conflicts.
Therefore, if you have uncommitted changes touching the same files as
the ones impacted by the merge, Git will refuse to proceed. Most of
the time, you will want to commit your changes before you can merge,
and if you don&#8217;t, then <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-stash" >}}'>git-stash[1]</a> can take these changes
away while you&#8217;re doing the merge, and reapply them afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the changes are independent enough, Git will automatically complete
the merge and commit the result (or reuse an existing commit in case
of <a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a>, see below). On the other hand,
if there are conflicts&#8212;&#8203;for example, if the same file is
modified in two different ways in the remote branch and the local
branch&#8212;&#8203;then you are warned; the output may look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git merge next
 100% (4/4) done
Auto-merged file.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conflict markers are left in the problematic files, and after
you resolve the conflicts manually, you can update the index
with the contents and run Git commit, as you normally would when
creating a new file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you examine the resulting commit using gitk, you will see that it
has two parents, one pointing to the top of the current branch, and
one to the top of the other branch.</p>

<h3 id="resolving-a-merge"><a class="anchor" href="#resolving-a-merge"></a>Resolving a merge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a merge isn&#8217;t resolved automatically, Git leaves the index and
the working tree in a special state that gives you all the
information you need to help resolve the merge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Files with conflicts are marked specially in the index, so until you
resolve the problem and update the index, <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-commit" >}}'>git-commit[1]</a> will
fail:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-status" >}}'>git-status[1]</a> will list those files as "unmerged", and the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of the changes that Git was able to merge automatically are
already added to the index file, so <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-diff" >}}'>git-diff[1]</a> shows only
the conflicts.  It uses an unusual syntax:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that the commit which will be committed after we resolve this
conflict will have two parents instead of the usual one: one parent
will be HEAD, the tip of the current branch; the other will be the
tip of the other branch, which is stored temporarily in MERGE_HEAD.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the merge, the index holds three versions of each file.  Each of
these three "file stages" represents a different version of the file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git show :1:file.txt	# the file in a common ancestor of both branches
$ git show :2:file.txt	# the version from HEAD.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you ask <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-diff" >}}'>git-diff[1]</a> to show the conflicts, it runs a
three-way diff between the conflicted merge results in the work tree with
stages 2 and 3 to show only hunks whose contents come from both sides,
mixed (in other words, when a hunk&#8217;s merge results come only from stage 2,
that part is not conflicting and is not shown.  Same for stage 3).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diff above shows the differences between the working-tree version of
file.txt and the stage 2 and stage 3 versions.  So instead of preceding
each line by a single <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>, it now uses two columns: the first
column is used for differences between the first parent and the working
directory copy, and the second for differences between the second parent
and the working directory copy.  (See the "COMBINED DIFF FORMAT" section
of <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-diff-files" >}}'>git-diff-files[1]</a> for a details of the format.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After resolving the conflict in the obvious way (but before updating the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This shows that our resolved version deleted "Hello world" from the
first parent, deleted "Goodbye" from the second parent, and added
"Goodbye world", which was previously absent from both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some special diff options allow diffing the working directory against
any of these stages:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git diff -1 file.txt		# diff against stage 1

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using the <em>ort</em> merge strategy (the default), before updating the working
tree with the result of the merge, Git writes a ref named AUTO_MERGE
reflecting the state of the tree it is about to write. Conflicted paths with
textual conflicts that could not be automatically merged are written to this
tree with conflict markers, just as in the working tree. AUTO_MERGE can thus be
used with <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-diff" >}}'>git-diff[1]</a> to show the changes you&#8217;ve made so far to resolve
conflicts. Using the same example as above, after resolving the conflict we

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you clone a repository and commit a few changes of your own, you
may wish to check the original repository for updates and merge them
into your own work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have already seen <a href="#Updating-a-repository-With-git-fetch">how to
keep remote-tracking branches up to date</a> with <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-fetch" >}}'>git-fetch[1]</a>,
and how to merge two branches.  So you can merge in changes from the

$ git merge origin/master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-pull" >}}'>git-pull[1]</a> command provides a way to do this in
one step:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git pull origin master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, if you have <code>master</code> checked out, then this branch has been
configured by <code>git clone</code> to get changes from the HEAD branch of the
origin repository.  So often you can
accomplish the above with just a simple</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git pull</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command will fetch changes from the remote branches to your
remote-tracking branches <code>origin/*</code>, and merge the default branch into
the current branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More generally, a branch that is created from a remote-tracking branch
will pull
by default from that branch.  See the descriptions of the
<code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</code> and <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code> options in
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a>, and the discussion of the <code>--track</code> option in
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-checkout" >}}'>git-checkout[1]</a>, to learn how to control these defaults.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to saving you keystrokes, <code>git pull</code> also helps you by
producing a default commit message documenting the branch and
repository that you pulled from.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(But note that no such commit will be created in the case of a
<a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a>; instead, your branch will just be
updated to point to the latest commit from the upstream branch.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git pull</code> command can also be given <code>.</code> as the "remote" repository,

<h3 id="submitting-patches"><a class="anchor" href="#submitting-patches"></a>Submitting patches to a project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you just have a few changes, the simplest way to submit them may
just be to send them as patches in email:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, use <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-format-patch" >}}'>git-format-patch[1]</a>; for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git format-patch origin</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>will produce a numbered series of files in the current directory, one
for each patch in the current branch but not in <code>origin/HEAD</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git format-patch</code> can include an initial "cover letter". You can insert
commentary on individual patches after the three dash line which
<code>format-patch</code> places after the commit message but before the patch
itself.  If you use <code>git notes</code> to track your cover letter material,
<code>git format-patch --notes</code> will include the commit&#8217;s notes in a similar
manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can then import these into your mail client and send them by
hand.  However, if you have a lot to send at once, you may prefer to
use the <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-send-email" >}}'>git-send-email[1]</a> script to automate the process.
Consult the mailing list for your project first to determine
their requirements for submitting patches.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="importing-patches"><a class="anchor" href="#importing-patches"></a>Importing patches to a project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git also provides a tool called <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-am" >}}'>git-am[1]</a> (am stands for
"apply mailbox"), for importing such an emailed series of patches.
Just save all of the patch-containing messages, in order, into a
single mailbox file, say <code>patches.mbox</code>, then run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git am -3 patches.mbox</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git will apply each patch in order; if any conflicts are found, it
will stop, and you can fix the conflicts as described in
"<a href="#resolving-a-merge">Resolving a merge</a>".  (The <code>-3</code> option tells
Git to perform a merge; if you would prefer it just to abort and
leave your tree and index untouched, you may omit that option.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the index is updated with the results of the conflict
resolution, instead of creating a new commit, just run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git am --continue</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and Git will create the commit for you and continue applying the
remaining patches from the mailbox.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final result will be a series of commits, one for each patch in
the original mailbox, with authorship and commit log message each
taken from the message containing each patch.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="public-repositories"><a class="anchor" href="#public-repositories"></a>Public Git repositories</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to submit changes to a project is to tell the maintainer
of that project to pull the changes from your repository using
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-pull" >}}'>git-pull[1]</a>.  In the section "<a href="#getting-updates-With-git-pull">Getting updates with <code>git pull</code></a>" we described this as a way to get
updates from the "main" repository, but it works just as well in the
other direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you and the maintainer both have accounts on the same machine, then
you can just pull changes from each other&#8217;s repositories directly;
commands that accept repository URLs as arguments will also accept a
local directory name:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git clone /path/to/repository
$ git pull /path/to/other/repository</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or an ssh URL:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git clone ssh://yourhost/~you/repository</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For projects with few developers, or for synchronizing a few private
repositories, this may be all you need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the more common way to do this is to maintain a separate public
repository (usually on a different host) for others to pull changes
from.  This is usually more convenient, and allows you to cleanly
separate private work in progress from publicly visible work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will continue to do your day-to-day work in your personal
repository, but periodically "push" changes from your personal
repository into your public repository, allowing other developers to
pull from that repository.  So the flow of changes, in a situation
where there is one other developer with a public repository, looks
like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>		      you push
your personal repo ------------------&gt; your public repo

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assume your personal repository is in the directory <code>~/proj</code>.  We
first create a new clone of the repository and tell <code>git daemon</code> that it
is meant to be public:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git clone --bare ~/proj proj.git

<p>The resulting directory proj.git contains a "bare" git repository&#8212;&#8203;it is
just the contents of the <code>.git</code> directory, without any files checked out
around it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, copy <code>proj.git</code> to the server where you plan to host the
public repository.  You can use scp, rsync, or whatever is most
convenient.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="exporting-via-git"><a class="anchor" href="#exporting-via-git"></a>Exporting a Git repository via the Git protocol</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the preferred method.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone else administers the server, they should tell you what
directory to put the repository in, and what <code>git://</code> URL it will
appear at.  You can then skip to the section
"<a href="#pushing-changes-to-a-public-repository">Pushing changes to a public
repository</a>", below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise, all you need to do is start <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-daemon" >}}'>git-daemon[1]</a>; it will
listen on port 9418.  By default, it will allow access to any directory
that looks like a Git directory and contains the magic file
git-daemon-export-ok.  Passing some directory paths as <code>git daemon</code>
arguments will further restrict the exports to those paths.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also run <code>git daemon</code> as an inetd service; see the

<p>The simplest way to do this is using <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-push" >}}'>git-push[1]</a> and ssh; to

<h4 id="forcing-push"><a class="anchor" href="#forcing-push"></a>What to do when a push fails</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a push would not result in a <a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a> of the
remote branch, then it will fail with an error like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to '...'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can happen, for example, if you:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>use <code>git reset --hard</code> to remove already-published commits, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use <code>git commit --amend</code> to replace already-published commits
(as in <a href="#fixing-a-mistake-by-rewriting-history">Fixing a mistake by rewriting history</a>), or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use <code>git rebase</code> to rebase any already-published commits (as
in <a href="#using-git-rebase">Keeping a patch series up to date using git rebase</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may force <code>git push</code> to perform the update anyway by preceding the
branch name with a plus sign:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git +master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the addition of the <code>+</code> sign.  Alternatively, you can use the
<code>-f</code> flag to force the remote update, as in:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git push -f ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally whenever a branch head in a public repository is modified, it
is modified to point to a descendant of the commit that it pointed to
before.  By forcing a push in this situation, you break that convention.
(See <a href="#problems-With-rewriting-history">Problems with rewriting history</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, this is a common practice for people that need a simple
way to publish a work-in-progress patch series, and it is an acceptable
compromise as long as you warn other developers that this is how you
intend to manage the branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also possible for a push to fail in this way when other people have
the right to push to the same repository.  In that case, the correct
solution is to retry the push after first updating your work: either by a
pull, or by a fetch followed by a rebase; see the
<a href="#setting-up-a-shared-repository">next section</a> and
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitcvs-migration" >}}'>gitcvs-migration[7]</a> for more.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="setting-up-a-shared-repository"><a class="anchor" href="#setting-up-a-shared-repository"></a>Setting up a shared repository</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to collaborate is by using a model similar to that
commonly used in CVS, where several developers with special rights
all push to and pull from a single shared repository.  See
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitcvs-migration" >}}'>gitcvs-migration[7]</a> for instructions on how to
set this up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, while there is nothing wrong with Git&#8217;s support for shared
repositories, this mode of operation is not generally recommended,
simply because the mode of collaboration that Git supports&#8212;&#8203;by
exchanging patches and pulling from public repositories&#8212;&#8203;has so many
advantages over the central shared repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Git&#8217;s ability to quickly import and merge patches allows a
single maintainer to process incoming changes even at very
high rates.  And when that becomes too much, <code>git pull</code> provides
an easy way for that maintainer to delegate this job to other
maintainers while still allowing optional review of incoming
changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since every developer&#8217;s repository has the same complete copy
of the project history, no repository is special, and it is
trivial for another developer to take over maintenance of a
project, either by mutual agreement, or because a maintainer
becomes unresponsive or difficult to work with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of a central group of "committers" means there is
less need for formal decisions about who is "in" and who is
"out".</p>

<p>This describes how Tony Luck uses Git in his role as maintainer of the

<p>He uses two public branches:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A "test" tree into which patches are initially placed so that they
can get some exposure when integrated with other ongoing development.
This tree is available to Andrew for pulling into -mm whenever he
wants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A "release" tree into which tested patches are moved for final sanity
checking, and as a vehicle to send them upstream to Linus (by sending
him a "please pull" request.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also uses a set of temporary branches ("topic branches"), each
containing a logical grouping of patches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To set this up, first create your work tree by cloning Linus&#8217;s public
tree:</p>

<div class="listingblock">

<p>Linus&#8217;s tree will be stored in the remote-tracking branch named origin/master,

public trees using <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-remote" >}}'>git-remote[1]</a> to set up a "remote" and
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-fetch" >}}'>git-fetch[1]</a> to keep them up to date; see
<a href="#repositories-and-branches">Repositories and Branches</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now create the branches in which you are going to work; these start out
at the current tip of origin/master branch, and should be set up (using
the <code>--track</code> option to <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-branch" >}}'>git-branch[1]</a>) to merge changes in from
Linus by default.</p>

<p>Important note!  If you have any local changes in these branches, then
this merge will create a commit object in the history (with no local
changes Git will simply do a "fast-forward" merge).  Many people dislike
the "noise" that this creates in the Linux history, so you should avoid
doing this capriciously in the <code>release</code> branch, as these noisy commits
will become part of the permanent history when you ask Linus to pull
from the release branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few configuration variables (see <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a>) can

<p>Now to apply some patches from the community.  Think of a short
snappy name for a branch to hold this patch (or related group of
patches), and create a new branch from a recent stable tag of
Linus&#8217;s branch. Picking a stable base for your branch will:
1) help you: by avoiding inclusion of unrelated and perhaps lightly
tested changes
2) help future bug hunters that use <code>git bisect</code> to find problems</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometime later when enough time has passed and testing done, you can pull the
same branch into the <code>release</code> tree ready to go upstream.  This is where you
see the value of keeping each patch (or patch series) in its own branch.  It
means that the patches can be moved into the <code>release</code> tree in any order.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some changes are so trivial that it is not necessary to create a separate

<div class="content">
<pre>$ git format-patch origin

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rebase your current HEAD on the last commit you want to retain as-is.
For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, use:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git rebase -i HEAD~5</pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will open your editor with a list of steps to be taken to perform
your rebase.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As explained in the comments, you can reorder commits, squash them
together, edit commit messages, etc. by editing the list.  Once you
are satisfied, save the list and close your editor, and the rebase
will begin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rebase will stop where <code>pick</code> has been replaced with <code>edit</code> or
when a step in the list fails to mechanically resolve conflicts and
needs your help.  When you are done editing and/or resolving conflicts
you can continue with <code>git rebase --continue</code>.  If you decide that
things are getting too hairy, you can always bail out with <code>git rebase
--abort</code>.  Even after the rebase is complete, you can still recover
the original branch by using the <a href="#reflogs">reflog</a>.</p>

<h3 id="problems-With-rewriting-history"><a class="anchor" href="#problems-With-rewriting-history"></a>Problems with rewriting history</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary problem with rewriting the history of a branch has to do
with merging.  Suppose somebody fetches your branch and merges it into
their branch, with a result something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
        \        \
         t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then suppose you modify the last three commits:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	 o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
	/
 o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we examined all this history together in one repository, it will
look like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	 o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
	/
 o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin
        \        \
         t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git has no way of knowing that the new head is an updated version of
the old head; it treats this situation exactly the same as it would if
two developers had independently done the work on the old and new heads
in parallel.  At this point, if someone attempts to merge the new head
in to their branch, Git will attempt to merge together the two (old and
new) lines of development, instead of trying to replace the old by the
new.  The results are likely to be unexpected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may still choose to publish branches whose history is rewritten,
and it may be useful for others to be able to fetch those branches in
order to examine or test them, but they should not attempt to pull such
branches into their own work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For true distributed development that supports proper merging,
published branches should never be rewritten.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="bisect-merges"><a class="anchor" href="#bisect-merges"></a>Why bisecting merge commits can be harder than bisecting linear history</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-bisect" >}}'>git-bisect[1]</a> command correctly handles history that
includes merge commits.  However, when the commit that it finds is a
merge commit, the user may need to work harder than usual to figure out
why that commit introduced a problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine this history:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>      ---Z---o---X---...---o---A---C---D
          \                       /
           o---o---Y---...---o---B</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose that on the upper line of development, the meaning of one
of the functions that exists at Z is changed at commit X.  The
commits from Z leading to A change both the function&#8217;s
implementation and all calling sites that exist at Z, as well
as new calling sites they add, to be consistent.  There is no
bug at A.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose that in the meantime on the lower line of development somebody
adds a new calling site for that function at commit Y.  The
commits from Z leading to B all assume the old semantics of that
function and the callers and the callee are consistent with each
other.  There is no bug at B, either.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose further that the two development lines merge cleanly at C,
so no conflict resolution is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, the code at C is broken, because the callers added
on the lower line of development have not been converted to the new
semantics introduced on the upper line of development.  So if all
you know is that D is bad, that Z is good, and that
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-bisect" >}}'>git-bisect[1]</a> identifies C as the culprit, how will you
figure out that the problem is due to this change in semantics?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the result of a <code>git bisect</code> is a non-merge commit, you should
normally be able to discover the problem by examining just that commit.
Developers can make this easy by breaking their changes into small
self-contained commits.  That won&#8217;t help in the case above, however,
because the problem isn&#8217;t obvious from examination of any single
commit; instead, a global view of the development is required.  To
make matters worse, the change in semantics in the problematic
function may be just one small part of the changes in the upper
line of development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, if instead of merging at C you had rebased the
history between Z to B on top of A, you would have gotten this
linear history:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    ---Z---o---X--...---o---A---o---o---Y*--...---o---B*--D*</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bisecting between Z and D* would hit a single culprit commit Y*,
and understanding why Y* was broken would probably be easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Partly for this reason, many experienced Git users, even when
working on an otherwise merge-heavy project, keep the history
linear by rebasing against the latest upstream version before
publishing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of using <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-remote" >}}'>git-remote[1]</a>, you can also choose just
to update one branch at a time, and to store it locally under an
arbitrary name:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git fetch origin todo:my-todo-work</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first argument, <code>origin</code>, just tells Git to fetch from the
repository you originally cloned from.  The second argument tells Git
to fetch the branch named <code>todo</code> from the remote repository, and to
store it locally under the name <code>refs/heads/my-todo-work</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also fetch branches from other repositories; so</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git master:example-master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>will create a new branch named <code>example-master</code> and store in it the
branch named <code>master</code> from the repository at the given URL.  If you
already have a branch named example-master, it will attempt to
<a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a> to the commit given by example.com&#8217;s

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="fetch-fast-forwards"><a class="anchor" href="#fetch-fast-forwards"></a>git fetch and fast-forwards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous example, when updating an existing branch, <code>git fetch</code>
checks to make sure that the most recent commit on the remote
branch is a descendant of the most recent commit on your copy of the
branch before updating your copy of the branch to point at the new
commit.  Git calls this process a <a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fast-forward looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> o--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of the branch
           \
            o--o--o &lt;-- new head of the branch</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases it is possible that the new head will <strong>not</strong> actually be
a descendant of the old head.  For example, the developer may have
realized a serious mistake was made and decided to backtrack,
resulting in a situation like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> o--o--o--o--a--b &lt;-- old head of the branch

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, <code>git fetch</code> will fail, and print out a warning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In that case, you can still force Git to update to the new head, as
described in the following section.  However, note that in the
situation above this may mean losing the commits labeled <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>,
unless you&#8217;ve already created a reference of your own pointing to
them.</p>

<p>We already saw in <a href="#understanding-commits">Understanding History: Commits</a> that all commits are stored
under a 40-digit "object name".  In fact, all the information needed to
represent the history of a project is stored in objects with such names.
In each case the name is calculated by taking the SHA-1 hash of the
contents of the object.  The SHA-1 hash is a cryptographic hash function.
What that means to us is that it is impossible to find two different
objects with the same name.  This has a number of advantages; among
others:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Git can quickly determine whether two objects are identical or not,
just by comparing names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since object names are computed the same way in every repository, the
same content stored in two repositories will always be stored under
the same name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git can detect errors when it reads an object, by checking that the
object&#8217;s name is still the SHA-1 hash of its contents.</p>

<li>
<p>A <a href="#def_tag_object">"tag" object</a> symbolically identifies and can be

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A "blob" object is nothing but a binary blob of data.  It doesn&#8217;t refer
to anything else or have attributes of any kind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the blob is entirely defined by its data, if two files in a
directory tree (or in multiple different versions of the repository)
have the same contents, they will share the same blob object. The object
is totally independent of its location in the directory tree, and
renaming a file does not change the object that file is associated with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that any tree or blob object can be examined using
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-show" >}}'>git-show[1]</a> with the &lt;revision&gt;:&lt;path&gt; syntax.  This can
sometimes be useful for browsing the contents of a tree that is not
currently checked out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="trust"><a class="anchor" href="#trust"></a>Trust</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you receive the SHA-1 name of a blob from one source, and its contents
from another (possibly untrusted) source, you can still trust that those
contents are correct as long as the SHA-1 name agrees.  This is because
the SHA-1 is designed so that it is infeasible to find different contents
that produce the same hash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, you need only trust the SHA-1 name of a top-level tree object
to trust the contents of the entire directory that it refers to, and if
you receive the SHA-1 name of a commit from a trusted source, then you
can easily verify the entire history of commits reachable through
parents of that commit, and all of those contents of the trees referred
to by those commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So to introduce some real trust in the system, the only thing you need
to do is to digitally sign just <em>one</em> special note, which includes the
name of a top-level commit.  Your digital signature shows others
that you trust that commit, and the immutability of the history of
commits tells others that they can trust the whole history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, you can easily validate a whole archive by just
sending out a single email that tells the people the name (SHA-1 hash)
of the top commit, and digitally sign that email using something
like GPG/PGP.</p>

<h4 id="pack-files"><a class="anchor" href="#pack-files"></a>How Git stores objects efficiently: pack files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Newly created objects are initially created in a file named after the
object&#8217;s SHA-1 hash (stored in <code>.git/objects</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately this system becomes inefficient once a project has a
lot of objects.  Try this on an old project:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git count-objects
6930 objects, 47620 kilobytes</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first number is the number of objects which are kept in
individual files.  The second is the amount of space taken up by
those "loose" objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can save space and make Git faster by moving these loose objects in
to a "pack file", which stores a group of objects in an efficient
compressed format; the details of how pack files are formatted can be
found in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitformat-pack" >}}'>gitformat-pack[5]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To put the loose objects into a pack, just run git repack:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git repack
Counting objects: 6020, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6020/6020), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6020/6020), done.
Total 6020 (delta 4070), reused 0 (delta 0)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This creates a single "pack file" in .git/objects/pack/
containing all currently unpacked objects.  You can then run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git prune</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to remove any of the "loose" objects that are now contained in the
pack.  This will also remove any unreferenced objects (which may be
created when, for example, you use <code>git reset</code> to remove a commit).
You can verify that the loose objects are gone by looking at the
<code>.git/objects</code> directory or by running</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git count-objects

<h4 id="dangling-objects"><a class="anchor" href="#dangling-objects"></a>Dangling objects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-fsck" >}}'>git-fsck[1]</a> command will sometimes complain about dangling
objects.  They are not a problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most common cause of dangling objects is that you&#8217;ve rebased a
branch, or you have pulled from somebody else who rebased a branch&#8212;&#8203;see
<a href="#cleaning-up-history">Rewriting history and maintaining patch series</a>.  In that case, the old head of the original
branch still exists, as does everything it pointed to. The branch
pointer itself just doesn&#8217;t, since you replaced it with another one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also other situations that cause dangling objects. For
example, a "dangling blob" may arise because you did a <code>git add</code> of a
file, but then, before you actually committed it and made it part of the
bigger picture, you changed something else in that file and committed
that <strong>updated</strong> thing&#8212;&#8203;the old state that you added originally ends up
not being pointed to by any commit or tree, so it&#8217;s now a dangling blob
object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, when the "ort" merge strategy runs, and finds that
there are criss-cross merges and thus more than one merge base (which is
fairly unusual, but it does happen), it will generate one temporary
midway tree (or possibly even more, if you had lots of criss-crossing
merges and more than two merge bases) as a temporary internal merge
base, and again, those are real objects, but the end result will not end
up pointing to them, so they end up "dangling" in your repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, dangling objects aren&#8217;t anything to worry about. They can
even be very useful: if you screw something up, the dangling objects can
be how you recover your old tree (say, you did a rebase, and realized
that you really didn&#8217;t want to&#8212;&#8203;you can look at what dangling objects
you have, and decide to reset your head to some old dangling state).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For commits, you can just use:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ gitk &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt; --not --all</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This asks for all the history reachable from the given commit but not
from any branch, tag, or other reference.  If you decide it&#8217;s something
you want, you can always create a new reference to it, e.g.,</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git branch recovered-branch &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For blobs and trees, you can&#8217;t do the same, but you can still examine
them.  You can just do</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git show &lt;dangling-blob/tree-sha-goes-here&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to show what the contents of the blob were (or, for a tree, basically
what the <code>ls</code> for that directory was), and that may give you some idea
of what the operation was that left that dangling object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, dangling blobs and trees aren&#8217;t very interesting. They&#8217;re
almost always the result of either being a half-way mergebase (the blob
will often even have the conflict markers from a merge in it, if you
have had conflicting merges that you fixed up by hand), or simply
because you interrupted a <code>git fetch</code> with ^C or something like that,
leaving <em>some</em> of the new objects in the object database, but just
dangling and useless.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, once you are sure that you&#8217;re not interested in any dangling
state, you can just prune all unreachable objects:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git prune</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and they&#8217;ll be gone. (You should only run <code>git prune</code> on a quiescent
repository&#8212;&#8203;it&#8217;s kind of like doing a filesystem fsck recovery: you
don&#8217;t want to do that while the filesystem is mounted.
<code>git prune</code> is designed not to cause any harm in such cases of concurrent
accesses to a repository but you might receive confusing or scary messages.)</p>

<h4 id="recovering-from-repository-corruption"><a class="anchor" href="#recovering-from-repository-corruption"></a>Recovering from repository corruption</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By design, Git treats data trusted to it with caution.  However, even in
the absence of bugs in Git itself, it is still possible that hardware or
operating system errors could corrupt data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first defense against such problems is backups.  You can back up a
Git directory using clone, or just using cp, tar, or any other backup
mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a last resort, you can search for the corrupted objects and attempt
to replace them by hand.  Back up your repository before attempting this
in case you corrupt things even more in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll assume that the problem is a single missing or corrupted blob,
which is sometimes a solvable problem.  (Recovering missing trees and
especially commits is <strong>much</strong> harder).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before starting, verify that there is corruption, and figure out where
it is with <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-fsck" >}}'>git-fsck[1]</a>; this may be time-consuming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assume the output looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git fsck --full --no-dangling
broken link from    tree 2d9263c6d23595e7cb2a21e5ebbb53655278dff8

missing blob 4b9458b3786228369c63936db65827de3cc06200</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you know that blob 4b9458b3 is missing, and that the tree 2d9263c6
points to it.  If you could find just one copy of that missing blob
object, possibly in some other repository, you could move it into
<code>.git/objects/4b/9458b3...</code> and be done.  Suppose you can&#8217;t.  You can
still examine the tree that pointed to it with <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-ls-tree" >}}'>git-ls-tree[1]</a>,
which might output something like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now you know that the missing blob was the data for a file named
<code>myfile</code>.  And chances are you can also identify the directory&#8212;&#8203;let&#8217;s
say it&#8217;s in <code>somedirectory</code>.  If you&#8217;re lucky the missing copy might be
the same as the copy you have checked out in your working tree at

<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-hash-object" >}}'>git-hash-object[1]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<p>which will create and store a blob object with the contents of

extremely lucky it might be 4b9458b3786228369c63936db65827de3cc06200, in
which case you&#8217;ve guessed right, and the corruption is fixed!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise, you need more information.  How do you tell which version of
the file has been lost?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest way to do this is with:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve been committing small enough changes, you may now have a good

<p>Note that in older documentation you may see the index called the

</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The index contains all the information necessary to generate a single
(uniquely determined) tree object.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, running <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-commit" >}}'>git-commit[1]</a> generates this tree object
from the index, stores it in the object database, and uses it as the
tree object associated with the new commit.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The index enables fast comparisons between the tree object it defines
and the working tree.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It does this by storing some additional data for each entry (such as
the last modified time).  This data is not displayed above, and is not
stored in the created tree object, but it can be used to determine
quickly which files in the working directory differ from what was
stored in the index, and thus save Git from having to read all of the
data from such files to look for changes.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can efficiently represent information about merge conflicts
between different tree objects, allowing each pathname to be
associated with sufficient information about the trees involved that
you can create a three-way merge between them.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We saw in <a href="#conflict-resolution">Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge</a> that during a merge the index can
store multiple versions of a single file (called "stages").  The third
column in the <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-ls-files" >}}'>git-ls-files[1]</a> output above is the stage
number, and will take on values other than 0 for files with merge
conflicts.</p>

<p>The index is thus a sort of temporary staging area, which is filled with
a tree which you are in the process of working on.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="submodules"><a class="anchor" href="#submodules"></a>Submodules</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Large projects are often composed of smaller, self-contained modules.  For
example, an embedded Linux distribution&#8217;s source tree would include every
piece of software in the distribution with some local modifications; a movie
player might need to build against a specific, known-working version of a
decompression library; several independent programs might all share the same
build scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With centralized revision control systems this is often accomplished by
including every module in one single repository.  Developers can check out
all modules or only the modules they need to work with.  They can even modify
files across several modules in a single commit while moving things around
or updating APIs and translations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git does not allow partial checkouts, so duplicating this approach in Git
would force developers to keep a local copy of modules they are not
interested in touching.  Commits in an enormous checkout would be slower
than you&#8217;d expect as Git would have to scan every directory for changes.
If modules have a lot of local history, clones would take forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the plus side, distributed revision control systems can much better
integrate with external sources.  In a centralized model, a single arbitrary
snapshot of the external project is exported from its own revision control
and then imported into the local revision control on a vendor branch.  All
the history is hidden.  With distributed revision control you can clone the
entire external history and much more easily follow development and re-merge
local changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git&#8217;s submodule support allows a repository to contain, as a subdirectory, a
checkout of an external project.  Submodules maintain their own identity;
the submodule support just stores the submodule repository location and
commit ID, so other developers who clone the containing project
("superproject") can easily clone all the submodules at the same revision.
Partial checkouts of the superproject are possible: you can tell Git to
clone none, some or all of the submodules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-submodule" >}}'>git-submodule[1]</a> command is available since Git 1.5.3.  Users
with Git 1.5.2 can look up the submodule commits in the repository and
manually check them out; earlier versions won&#8217;t recognize the submodules at
all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see how submodule support works, create four example
repositories that can be used later as a submodule:</p>

<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-restore" >}}'>git-restore[1]</a> work by moving data
between the working tree, the index, and the object database.  Git
provides low-level operations which perform each of these steps
individually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, all Git operations work on the index file. Some operations
work <strong>purely</strong> on the index file (showing the current state of the
index), but most operations move data between the index file and either
the database or the working directory. Thus there are four main
combinations:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="working-directory-to-index"><a class="anchor" href="#working-directory-to-index"></a>working directory &#8594; index</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-update-index" >}}'>git-update-index[1]</a> command updates the index with
information from the working directory.  You generally update the
index information by just specifying the filename you want to update,
like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git update-index filename</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>but to avoid common mistakes with filename globbing etc., the command
will not normally add totally new entries or remove old entries,
i.e. it will normally just update existing cache entries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To tell Git that yes, you really do realize that certain files no
longer exist, or that new files should be added, you
should use the <code>--remove</code> and <code>--add</code> flags respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NOTE! A <code>--remove</code> flag does <em>not</em> mean that subsequent filenames will
necessarily be removed: if the files still exist in your directory
structure, the index will be updated with their new status, not
removed. The only thing <code>--remove</code> means is that update-index will be
considering a removed file to be a valid thing, and if the file really
does not exist any more, it will update the index accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a special case, you can also do <code>git update-index --refresh</code>, which
will refresh the "stat" information of each index to match the current
stat information. It will <em>not</em> update the object status itself, and
it will only update the fields that are used to quickly test whether
an object still matches its old backing store object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previously introduced <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-add" >}}'>git-add[1]</a> is just a wrapper for
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-update-index" >}}'>git-update-index[1]</a>.</p>

<p>that doesn&#8217;t come with any options&#8212;&#8203;it will just write out the
current index into the set of tree objects that describe that state,
and it will return the name of the resulting top-level tree. You can
use that tree to re-generate the index at any time by going in the
other direction:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="object-database-to-index"><a class="anchor" href="#object-database-to-index"></a>object database &#8594; index</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You read a "tree" file from the object database, and use that to

index.  Normal operation is just</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>$ git read-tree &lt;SHA-1 of tree&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and your index file will now be equivalent to the tree that you saved
earlier. However, that is only your <em>index</em> file: your working
directory contents have not been modified.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="index-to-working-directory"><a class="anchor" href="#index-to-working-directory"></a>index &#8594; working directory</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You update your working directory from the index by "checking out"
files. This is not a very common operation, since normally you&#8217;d just
keep your files updated, and rather than write to your working
directory, you&#8217;d tell the index files about the changes in your
working directory (i.e. <code>git update-index</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if you decide to jump to a new version, or check out somebody
else&#8217;s version, or just restore a previous tree, you&#8217;d populate your
index file with read-tree, and then you need to check out the result
with</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git checkout-index filename</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or, if you want to check out all of the index, use <code>-a</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NOTE! <code>git checkout-index</code> normally refuses to overwrite old files, so
if you have an old version of the tree already checked out, you will
need to use the <code>-f</code> flag (<em>before</em> the <code>-a</code> flag or the filename) to
<em>force</em> the checkout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there are a few odds and ends which are not purely moving
from one representation to the other:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To commit a tree you have instantiated with <code>git write-tree</code>, you&#8217;d
create a "commit" object that refers to that tree and the history
behind it&#8212;&#8203;most notably the "parent" commits that preceded it in
history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally a "commit" has one parent: the previous state of the tree
before a certain change was made. However, sometimes it can have two
or more parent commits, in which case we call it a "merge", due to the
fact that such a commit brings together ("merges") two or more
previous states represented by other commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, while a "tree" represents a particular directory state
of a working directory, a "commit" represents that state in time,
and explains how we got there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You create a commit object by giving it the tree that describes the
state at the time of the commit, and a list of parents:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git commit-tree &lt;tree&gt; -p &lt;parent&gt; [(-p &lt;parent2&gt;)...]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and then giving the reason for the commit on stdin (either through
redirection from a pipe or file, or by just typing it at the tty).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git commit-tree</code> will return the name of the object that represents
that commit, and you should save it away for later use. Normally,
you&#8217;d commit a new <code>HEAD</code> state, and while Git doesn&#8217;t care where you
save the note about that state, in practice we tend to just write the
result to the file pointed at by <code>.git/HEAD</code>, so that we can always see
what the last committed state was.</p>

<p>Git can help you perform a three-way merge, which can in turn be
used for a many-way merge by repeating the merge procedure several
times.  The usual situation is that you only do one three-way merge
(reconciling two lines of history) and commit the result, but if
you like to, you can merge several branches in one go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To perform a three-way merge, you start with the two commits you
want to merge, find their closest common parent (a third commit),
and compare the trees corresponding to these three commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the "base" for the merge, look up the common parent of two
commits:</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>$ git merge-base &lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt;</pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you know the three trees you are going to merge (the one "original"
tree, aka the common tree, and the two "result" trees, aka the branches
you want to merge), you do a "merge" read into the index. This will
complain if it has to throw away your old index contents, so you should
make sure that you&#8217;ve committed those&#8212;&#8203;in fact you would normally
always do a merge against your last commit (which should thus match what

<p>Sadly, many merges aren&#8217;t trivial. If there are files that have
been added, moved or removed, or if both branches have modified the
same file, you will be left with an index tree that contains "merge

object, and you will have to resolve any such merge clashes using
other tools before you can write out the result.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each line of the <code>git ls-files --unmerged</code> output begins with
the blob mode bits, blob SHA-1, <em>stage number</em>, and the
filename.  The <em>stage number</em> is Git&#8217;s way to say which tree it
came from: stage 1 corresponds to the <code>$orig</code> tree, stage 2 to
the <code>HEAD</code> tree, and stage 3 to the <code>$target</code> tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Earlier we said that trivial merges are done inside
<code>git read-tree -m</code>.  For example, if the file did not change
from <code>$orig</code> to <code>HEAD</code> or <code>$target</code>, or if the file changed
from <code>$orig</code> to <code>HEAD</code> and <code>$orig</code> to <code>$target</code> the same way,
obviously the final outcome is what is in <code>HEAD</code>.  What the
above example shows is that file <code>hello.c</code> was changed from
<code>$orig</code> to <code>HEAD</code> and <code>$orig</code> to <code>$target</code> in a different way.
You could resolve this by running your favorite 3-way merge
program, e.g.  <code>diff3</code>, <code>merge</code>, or Git&#8217;s own merge-file, on
the blob objects from these three stages yourself, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git cat-file blob 263414f &gt;hello.c~1
$ git cat-file blob 06fa6a2 &gt;hello.c~2
$ git cat-file blob cc44c73 &gt;hello.c~3
$ git merge-file hello.c~2 hello.c~1 hello.c~3</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would leave the merge result in <code>hello.c~2</code> file, along
with conflict markers if there are conflicts.  After verifying
the merge result makes sense, you can tell Git what the final
merge result for this file is by:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ mv -f hello.c~2 hello.c
$ git update-index hello.c</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a path is in the "unmerged" state, running <code>git update-index</code> for
that path tells Git to mark the path resolved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above is the description of a Git merge at the lowest level,
to help you understand what conceptually happens under the hood.
In practice, nobody, not even Git itself, runs <code>git cat-file</code> three times
for this.  There is a <code>git merge-index</code> program that extracts the
stages to temporary files and calls a "merge" script on it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file hello.c</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and that is what higher level <code>git merge -s resolve</code> is implemented with.</p>

<h2 id="hacking-git"><a class="anchor" href="#hacking-git"></a>Hacking Git</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter covers internal details of the Git implementation which
probably only Git developers need to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="object-details"><a class="anchor" href="#object-details"></a>Object storage format</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All objects have a statically determined "type" which identifies the
format of the object (i.e. how it is used, and how it can refer to other
objects).  There are currently four different object types: "blob",
"tree", "commit", and "tag".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of object type, all objects share the following
characteristics: they are all deflated with zlib, and have a header
that not only specifies their type, but also provides size information
about the data in the object.  It&#8217;s worth noting that the SHA-1 hash
that is used to name the object is the hash of the original data
plus this header, so <code>sha1sum</code> <em>file</em> does not match the object name
for <em>file</em> (the earliest versions of Git hashed slightly differently
but the conclusion is still the same).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is a short example that demonstrates how these hashes
can be generated manually:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s assume a small text file with some simple content:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ echo "Hello world" &gt;hello.txt</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can now manually generate the hash Git would use for this file:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The object we want the hash for is of type "blob" and its size is
12 bytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepend the object header to the file content and feed this to
<code>sha1sum</code>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ { printf "blob 12\0"; cat hello.txt; } | sha1sum
802992c4220de19a90767f3000a79a31b98d0df7  -</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This manually constructed hash can be verified using <code>git hash-object</code>
which of course hides the addition of the header:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git hash-object hello.txt
802992c4220de19a90767f3000a79a31b98d0df7</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result, the general consistency of an object can always be tested
independently of the contents or the type of the object: all objects can
be validated by verifying that (a) their hashes match the content of the
file and (b) the object successfully inflates to a stream of bytes that
forms a sequence of
<code>&lt;ascii-type-without-space&gt; + &lt;space&gt; + &lt;ascii-decimal-size&gt; +
&lt;byte\0&gt; + &lt;binary-object-data&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The structured objects can further have their structure and
connectivity to other objects verified. This is generally done with
the <code>git fsck</code> program, which generates a full dependency graph
of all objects, and verifies their internal consistency (in addition
to just verifying their superficial consistency through the hash).</p>

<h3 id="birdview-on-the-source-code"><a class="anchor" href="#birdview-on-the-source-code"></a>A birds-eye view of Git&#8217;s source code</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not always easy for new developers to find their way through Git&#8217;s
source code.  This section gives you a little guidance to show where to
start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good place to start is with the contents of the initial commit, with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git switch --detach e83c5163</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initial revision lays the foundation for almost everything Git has
today (even though details may differ in a few places), but is small
enough to read in one sitting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that terminology has changed since that revision.  For example, the
README in that revision uses the word "changeset" to describe what we
now call a <a href="#def_commit_object">commit</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, we do not call it "cache" any more, but rather "index"; however,
the file is still called <code>read-cache.h</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you grasp the ideas in that initial commit, you should check out a
more recent version and skim <code>read-cache-ll.h</code>, <code>object.h</code> and <code>commit.h</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the early days, Git (in the tradition of UNIX) was a bunch of programs
which were extremely simple, and which you used in scripts, piping the
output of one into another. This turned out to be good for initial
development, since it was easier to test new things.  However, recently
many of these parts have become builtins, and some of the core has been
"libified", i.e. put into libgit.a for performance, portability reasons,
and to avoid code duplication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By now, you know what the index is (and find the corresponding data
structures in <code>read-cache-ll.h</code>), and that there are just a couple of
object types (blobs, trees, commits and tags) which inherit their
common structure from <code>struct object</code>, which is their first member
(and thus, you can cast e.g.  <code>(struct object *)commit</code> to achieve the
<em>same</em> as <code>&amp;commit-&gt;object</code>, i.e.  get at the object name and flags).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now is a good point to take a break to let this information sink in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next step: get familiar with the object naming.  Read <a href="#naming-commits">Naming commits</a>.
There are quite a few ways to name an object (and not only revisions!).
All of these are handled in <code>sha1_name.c</code>. Just have a quick look at
the function <code>get_sha1()</code>. A lot of the special handling is done by
functions like <code>get_sha1_basic()</code> or the likes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is just to get you into the groove for the most libified part of Git:
the revision walker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically, the initial version of <code>git log</code> was a shell script:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git-rev-list --pretty $(git-rev-parse --default HEAD "$@") | \
	LESS=-S ${PAGER:-less}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does this mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git rev-list</code> is the original version of the revision walker, which
<em>always</em> printed a list of revisions to stdout.  It is still functional,
and needs to, since most new Git commands start out as scripts using
<code>git rev-list</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git rev-parse</code> is not as important any more; it was only used to filter out
options that were relevant for the different plumbing commands that were
called by the script.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of what <code>git rev-list</code> did is contained in <code>revision.c</code> and
<code>revision.h</code>.  It wraps the options in a struct named <code>rev_info</code>, which
controls how and what revisions are walked, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original job of <code>git rev-parse</code> is now taken by the function
<code>setup_revisions()</code>, which parses the revisions and the common command-line
options for the revision walker. This information is stored in the struct
<code>rev_info</code> for later consumption. You can do your own command-line option
parsing after calling <code>setup_revisions()</code>. After that, you have to call
<code>prepare_revision_walk()</code> for initialization, and then you can get the
commits one by one with the function <code>get_revision()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are interested in more details of the revision walking process,
just have a look at the first implementation of <code>cmd_log()</code>; call
<code>git show v1.3.0~155^2~4</code> and scroll down to that function (note that you
no longer need to call <code>setup_pager()</code> directly).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nowadays, <code>git log</code> is a builtin, which means that it is <em>contained</em> in the
command <code>git</code>.  The source side of a builtin is</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>a function called <code>cmd_&lt;bla&gt;</code>, typically defined in <code>builtin/&lt;bla.c&gt;</code>
(note that older versions of Git used to have it in <code>builtin-&lt;bla&gt;.c</code>
instead), and declared in <code>builtin.h</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an entry in the <code>commands[]</code> array in <code>git.c</code>, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an entry in <code>BUILTIN_OBJECTS</code> in the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, more than one builtin is contained in one source file.  For
example, <code>cmd_whatchanged()</code> and <code>cmd_log()</code> both reside in <code>builtin/log.c</code>,
since they share quite a bit of code.  In that case, the commands which are
<em>not</em> named like the <code>.c</code> file in which they live have to be listed in
<code>BUILT_INS</code> in the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git log</code> looks more complicated in C than it does in the original script,
but that allows for a much greater flexibility and performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here again it is a good point to take a pause.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lesson three is: study the code.  Really, it is the best way to learn about
the organization of Git (after you know the basic concepts).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, think about something which you are interested in, say, "how can I
access a blob just knowing the object name of it?".  The first step is to
find a Git command with which you can do it.  In this example, it is either
<code>git show</code> or <code>git cat-file</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the sake of clarity, let&#8217;s stay with <code>git cat-file</code>, because it</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>is plumbing, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was around even in the initial commit (it literally went only through
some 20 revisions as <code>cat-file.c</code>, was renamed to <code>builtin/cat-file.c</code>
when made a builtin, and then saw less than 10 versions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, look into <code>builtin/cat-file.c</code>, search for <code>cmd_cat_file()</code> and look what
it does.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>        git_config(git_default_config);
        if (argc != 3)
		usage("git cat-file [-t|-s|-e|-p|&lt;type&gt;] &lt;sha1&gt;");
        if (get_sha1(argv[2], sha1))
                die("Not a valid object name %s", argv[2]);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s skip over the obvious details; the only really interesting part
here is the call to <code>get_sha1()</code>.  It tries to interpret <code>argv[2]</code> as an
object name, and if it refers to an object which is present in the current
repository, it writes the resulting SHA-1 into the variable <code>sha1</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two things are interesting here:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>get_sha1()</code> returns 0 on <em>success</em>.  This might surprise some new
Git hackers, but there is a long tradition in UNIX to return different
negative numbers in case of different errors&#8212;&#8203;and 0 on success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the variable <code>sha1</code> in the function signature of <code>get_sha1()</code> is <code>unsigned
char *</code>, but is actually expected to be a pointer to <code>unsigned
char[20]</code>.  This variable will contain the 160-bit SHA-1 of the given
commit.  Note that whenever a SHA-1 is passed as <code>unsigned char *</code>, it
is the binary representation, as opposed to the ASCII representation in
hex characters, which is passed as <code>char *</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will see both of these things throughout the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, for the meat:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>        case 0:
                buf = read_object_with_reference(sha1, argv[1], &amp;size, NULL);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is how you read a blob (actually, not only a blob, but any type of
object).  To know how the function <code>read_object_with_reference()</code> actually
works, find the source code for it (something like <code>git grep
read_object_with | grep ":[a-z]"</code> in the Git repository), and read
the source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To find out how the result can be used, just read on in <code>cmd_cat_file()</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>        write_or_die(1, buf, size);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, you do not know where to look for a feature.  In many such cases,
it helps to search through the output of <code>git log</code>, and then <code>git show</code> the
corresponding commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example: If you know that there was some test case for <code>git bundle</code>, but
do not remember where it was (yes, you <em>could</em> <code>git grep bundle t/</code>, but that
does not illustrate the point!):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git log --no-merges t/</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the pager (<code>less</code>), just search for "bundle", go a few lines back,
and see that it is in commit 18449ab0.  Now just copy this object name,
and paste it into the command line</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git show 18449ab0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Voila.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example: Find out what to do in order to make some script a
builtin:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git log --no-merges --diff-filter=A builtin/*.c</pre>
</div>

itself!</p>

The "magic signature" consists of ASCII symbols that are neither

<p>A repository can have zero (i.e. bare repository) or one or
more worktrees attached to it. One "worktree" consists of a
"working tree" and repository metadata, most of which are
shared among other worktrees of a single repository, and
some of which are maintained separately per worktree
(e.g. the index, HEAD and pseudorefs like MERGE_HEAD,
per-worktree refs and per-worktree configuration file).</p>

<p>The basic requirements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It must be readable in order, from beginning to end, by someone
intelligent with a basic grasp of the UNIX command line, but without
any special knowledge of Git.  If necessary, any other prerequisites
should be specifically mentioned as they arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever possible, section headings should clearly describe the task
they explain how to do, in language that requires no more knowledge
than necessary: for example, "importing patches into a project" rather
than "the <code>git am</code> command"</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think about how to create a clear chapter dependency graph that will
allow people to get to important topics without necessarily reading
everything in between.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scan <code>Documentation/</code> for other stuff left out; in particular:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>howto&#8217;s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some of <code>technical/</code>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hooks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>list of commands in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git" >}}'>git[1]</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scan email archives for other stuff left out</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scan man pages to see if any assume more background than this manual
provides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Add more good examples.  Entire sections of just cookbook examples
might be a good idea; maybe make an "advanced examples" section a
standard end-of-chapter section?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Include cross-references to the glossary, where appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Add a section on working with other version control systems, including
CVS, Subversion, and just imports of series of release tarballs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Write a chapter on using plumbing and writing scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternates, clone -reference, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
