NAME
----
git-rev-parse - Pick out and massage parameters


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git rev-parse' [<options>] <args>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Many Git porcelainish commands take mixture of flags
(i.e. parameters that begin with a dash '-') and parameters
meant for the underlying 'git rev-list' command they use internally
and flags and parameters for the other commands they use
downstream of 'git rev-list'.  This command is used to
distinguish between them.


OPTIONS
-------

Operation Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of these options must appear first on the command line.

--parseopt::
	Use 'git rev-parse' in option parsing mode (see PARSEOPT section below).

--sq-quote::
	Use 'git rev-parse' in shell quoting mode (see SQ-QUOTE
	section below). In contrast to the `--sq` option below, this
	mode does only quoting. Nothing else is done to command input.

Options for --parseopt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--keep-dashdash::
	Only meaningful in `--parseopt` mode. Tells the option parser to echo
	out the first `--` met instead of skipping it.

--stop-at-non-option::
	Only meaningful in `--parseopt` mode.  Lets the option parser stop at
	the first non-option argument.  This can be used to parse sub-commands
	that take options themselves.

--stuck-long::
	Only meaningful in `--parseopt` mode. Output the options in their
	long form if available, and with their arguments stuck.

Options for Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--revs-only::
	Do not output flags and parameters not meant for
	'git rev-list' command.

--no-revs::
	Do not output flags and parameters meant for
	'git rev-list' command.

--flags::
	Do not output non-flag parameters.

--no-flags::
	Do not output flag parameters.

Options for Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--default <arg>::
	If there is no parameter given by the user, use `<arg>`
	instead.

--prefix <arg>::
	Behave as if 'git rev-parse' was invoked from the `<arg>`
	subdirectory of the working tree.  Any relative filenames are
	resolved as if they are prefixed by `<arg>` and will be printed
	in that form.
+
This can be used to convert arguments to a command run in a subdirectory
so that they can still be used after moving to the top-level of the
repository.  For example:
+
----
prefix=$(git rev-parse --show-prefix)
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
# rev-parse provides the -- needed for 'set'
eval "set $(git rev-parse --sq --prefix "$prefix" -- "$@")"
----

--verify::
	Verify that exactly one parameter is provided, and that it
	can be turned into a raw 20-byte SHA-1 that can be used to
	access the object database. If so, emit it to the standard
	output; otherwise, error out.
+
If you want to make sure that the output actually names an object in
your object database and/or can be used as a specific type of object
you require, you can add the `^{type}` peeling operator to the parameter.
For example, `git rev-parse "$VAR^{commit}"` will make sure `$VAR`
names an existing object that is a commit-ish (i.e. a commit, or an
annotated tag that points at a commit).  To make sure that `$VAR`
names an existing object of any type, `git rev-parse "$VAR^{object}"`
can be used.
+
Note that if you are verifying a name from an untrusted source, it is
wise to use `--end-of-options` so that the name argument is not mistaken
for another option.

-q::
--quiet::
	Only meaningful in `--verify` mode. Do not output an error
	message if the first argument is not a valid object name;
	instead exit with non-zero status silently.
	SHA-1s for valid object names are printed to stdout on success.

--sq::
	Usually the output is made one line per flag and
	parameter.  This option makes output a single line,
	properly quoted for consumption by shell.  Useful when
	you expect your parameter to contain whitespaces and
	newlines (e.g. when using pickaxe `-S` with
	'git diff-{asterisk}'). In contrast to the `--sq-quote` option,
	the command input is still interpreted as usual.

--short[=length]::
	Same as `--verify` but shortens the object name to a unique
	prefix with at least `length` characters. The minimum length
	is 4, the default is the effective value of the `core.abbrev`
	configuration variable (see linkgit:git-config[1]).

--not::
	When showing object names, prefix them with '{caret}' and
	strip '{caret}' prefix from the object names that already have
	one.

--abbrev-ref[=(strict|loose)]::
	A non-ambiguous short name of the objects name.
	The option core.warnAmbiguousRefs is used to select the strict
	abbreviation mode.

--symbolic::
	Usually the object names are output in SHA-1 form (with
	possible '{caret}' prefix); this option makes them output in a
	form as close to the original input as possible.

--symbolic-full-name::
	This is similar to --symbolic, but it omits input that
	are not refs (i.e. branch or tag names; or more
	explicitly disambiguating "heads/master" form, when you
	want to name the "master" branch when there is an
	unfortunately named tag "master"), and show them as full
	refnames (e.g. "refs/heads/master").

Options for Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--all::
	Show all refs found in `refs/`.

--branches[=pattern]::
--tags[=pattern]::
--remotes[=pattern]::
	Show all branches, tags, or remote-tracking branches,
	respectively (i.e., refs found in `refs/heads`,
	`refs/tags`, or `refs/remotes`, respectively).
+
If a `pattern` is given, only refs matching the given shell glob are
shown.  If the pattern does not contain a globbing character (`?`,
`*`, or `[`), it is turned into a prefix match by appending `/*`.

--glob=pattern::
	Show all refs matching the shell glob pattern `pattern`. If
	the pattern does not start with `refs/`, this is automatically
	prepended.  If the pattern does not contain a globbing
	character (`?`, `*`, or `[`), it is turned into a prefix
	match by appending `/*`.

--exclude=<glob-pattern>::
	Do not include refs matching '<glob-pattern>' that the next `--all`,
	`--branches`, `--tags`, `--remotes`, or `--glob` would otherwise
	consider. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns
	up to the next `--all`, `--branches`, `--tags`, `--remotes`, or
	`--glob` option (other options or arguments do not clear
	accumulated patterns).
+
The patterns given should not begin with `refs/heads`, `refs/tags`, or
`refs/remotes` when applied to `--branches`, `--tags`, or `--remotes`,
respectively, and they must begin with `refs/` when applied to `--glob`
or `--all`. If a trailing '/{asterisk}' is intended, it must be given
explicitly.

--disambiguate=<prefix>::
	Show every object whose name begins with the given prefix.
	The <prefix> must be at least 4 hexadecimal digits long to
	avoid listing each and every object in the repository by
	mistake.

Options for Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--local-env-vars::
	List the GIT_* environment variables that are local to the
	repository (e.g. GIT_DIR or GIT_WORK_TREE, but not GIT_EDITOR).
	Only the names of the variables are listed, not their value,
	even if they are set.

--path-format=(absolute|relative)::
	Controls the behavior of certain other options. If specified as absolute, the
	paths printed by those options will be absolute and canonical. If specified as
	relative, the paths will be relative to the current working directory if that
	is possible.  The default is option specific.
+
This option may be specified multiple times and affects only the arguments that
follow it on the command line, either to the end of the command line or the next
instance of this option.

The following options are modified by `--path-format`:

--git-dir::
	Show `$GIT_DIR` if defined. Otherwise show the path to
	the .git directory. The path shown, when relative, is
	relative to the current working directory.
+
If `$GIT_DIR` is not defined and the current directory
is not detected to lie in a Git repository or work tree
print a message to stderr and exit with nonzero status.

--git-common-dir::
	Show `$GIT_COMMON_DIR` if defined, else `$GIT_DIR`.

--resolve-git-dir <path>::
	Check if <path> is a valid repository or a gitfile that
	points at a valid repository, and print the location of the
	repository.  If <path> is a gitfile then the resolved path
	to the real repository is printed.

--git-path <path>::
	Resolve "$GIT_DIR/<path>" and takes other path relocation
	variables such as $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY,
	$GIT_INDEX_FILE... into account. For example, if
	$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY is set to /foo/bar then "git rev-parse
	--git-path objects/abc" returns /foo/bar/abc.

--show-toplevel::
	Show the (by default, absolute) path of the top-level directory
	of the working tree. If there is no working tree, report an error.

--show-superproject-working-tree::
	Show the absolute path of the root of the superproject's
	working tree (if exists) that uses the current repository as
	its submodule.  Outputs nothing if the current repository is
	not used as a submodule by any project.

--shared-index-path::
	Show the path to the shared index file in split index mode, or
	empty if not in split-index mode.

The following options are unaffected by `--path-format`:

--absolute-git-dir::
	Like `--git-dir`, but its output is always the canonicalized
	absolute path.

--is-inside-git-dir::
	When the current working directory is below the repository
	directory print "true", otherwise "false".

--is-inside-work-tree::
	When the current working directory is inside the work tree of the
	repository print "true", otherwise "false".

--is-bare-repository::
	When the repository is bare print "true", otherwise "false".

--is-shallow-repository::
	When the repository is shallow print "true", otherwise "false".

--show-cdup::
	When the command is invoked from a subdirectory, show the
	path of the top-level directory relative to the current
	directory (typically a sequence of "../", or an empty string).

--show-prefix::
	When the command is invoked from a subdirectory, show the
	path of the current directory relative to the top-level
	directory.

--show-object-format[=(storage|input|output)]::
	Show the object format (hash algorithm) used for the repository
	for storage inside the `.git` directory, input, or output. For
	input, multiple algorithms may be printed, space-separated.
	If not specified, the default is "storage".


Other Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--since=datestring::
--after=datestring::
	Parse the date string, and output the corresponding
	--max-age= parameter for 'git rev-list'.

--until=datestring::
--before=datestring::
	Parse the date string, and output the corresponding
	--min-age= parameter for 'git rev-list'.

<args>...::
	Flags and parameters to be parsed.


SPECIFYING REVISIONS
--------------------

A revision parameter '<rev>' typically, but not necessarily, names a
commit object.  It uses what is called an 'extended SHA-1'
syntax.  Here are various ways to spell object names.  The
ones listed near the end of this list name trees and
blobs contained in a commit.

NOTE: This document shows the "raw" syntax as seen by git. The shell
and other UIs might require additional quoting to protect special
characters and to avoid word splitting.

'<sha1>', e.g. 'dae86e1950b1277e545cee180551750029cfe735', 'dae86e'::
  The full SHA-1 object name (40-byte hexadecimal string), or
  a leading substring that is unique within the repository.
  E.g. dae86e1950b1277e545cee180551750029cfe735 and dae86e both
  name the same commit object if there is no other object in
  your repository whose object name starts with dae86e.

'<describeOutput>', e.g. 'v1.7.4.2-679-g3bee7fb'::
  Output from `git describe`; i.e. a closest tag, optionally
  followed by a dash and a number of commits, followed by a dash, a
  'g', and an abbreviated object name.

'<refname>', e.g. 'master', 'heads/master', 'refs/heads/master'::
  A symbolic ref name.  E.g. 'master' typically means the commit
  object referenced by 'refs/heads/master'.  If you
  happen to have both 'heads/master' and 'tags/master', you can
  explicitly say 'heads/master' to tell Git which one you mean.
  When ambiguous, a '<refname>' is disambiguated by taking the
  first match in the following rules:

  . If '$GIT_DIR/<refname>' exists, that is what you mean (this is usually
    useful only for `HEAD`, `FETCH_HEAD`, `ORIG_HEAD`, `MERGE_HEAD`
    and `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`);

  . otherwise, 'refs/<refname>' if it exists;

  . otherwise, 'refs/tags/<refname>' if it exists;

  . otherwise, 'refs/heads/<refname>' if it exists;

  . otherwise, 'refs/remotes/<refname>' if it exists;

  . otherwise, 'refs/remotes/<refname>/HEAD' if it exists.
+
`HEAD` names the commit on which you based the changes in the working tree.
`FETCH_HEAD` records the branch which you fetched from a remote repository
with your last `git fetch` invocation.
`ORIG_HEAD` is created by commands that move your `HEAD` in a drastic
way, to record the position of the `HEAD` before their operation, so that
you can easily change the tip of the branch back to the state before you ran
them.
`MERGE_HEAD` records the commit(s) which you are merging into your branch
when you run `git merge`.
`CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` records the commit which you are cherry-picking
when you run `git cherry-pick`.
+
Note that any of the 'refs/*' cases above may come either from
the `$GIT_DIR/refs` directory or from the `$GIT_DIR/packed-refs` file.
While the ref name encoding is unspecified, UTF-8 is preferred as
some output processing may assume ref names in UTF-8.

'@'::
  '@' alone is a shortcut for `HEAD`.

'[<refname>]@{<date>}', e.g. 'master@\{yesterday\}', 'HEAD@{5 minutes ago}'::
  A ref followed by the suffix '@' with a date specification
  enclosed in a brace
  pair (e.g. '\{yesterday\}', '{1 month 2 weeks 3 days 1 hour 1
  second ago}' or '{1979-02-26 18:30:00}') specifies the value
  of the ref at a prior point in time.  This suffix may only be
  used immediately following a ref name and the ref must have an
  existing log ('$GIT_DIR/logs/<ref>'). Note that this looks up the state
  of your *local* ref at a given time; e.g., what was in your local
  'master' branch last week. If you want to look at commits made during
  certain times, see `--since` and `--until`.

'<refname>@{<n>}', e.g. 'master@\{1\}'::
  A ref followed by the suffix '@' with an ordinal specification
  enclosed in a brace pair (e.g. '\{1\}', '\{15\}') specifies
  the n-th prior value of that ref.  For example 'master@\{1\}'
  is the immediate prior value of 'master' while 'master@\{5\}'
  is the 5th prior value of 'master'. This suffix may only be used
  immediately following a ref name and the ref must have an existing
  log ('$GIT_DIR/logs/<refname>').

'@{<n>}', e.g. '@\{1\}'::
  You can use the '@' construct with an empty ref part to get at a
  reflog entry of the current branch. For example, if you are on
  branch 'blabla' then '@\{1\}' means the same as 'blabla@\{1\}'.

'@{-<n>}', e.g. '@{-1}'::
  The construct '@{-<n>}' means the <n>th branch/commit checked out
  before the current one.

'[<branchname>]@\{upstream\}', e.g. 'master@\{upstream\}', '@\{u\}'::
  The suffix '@\{upstream\}' to a branchname (short form '<branchname>@\{u\}')
  refers to the branch that the branch specified by branchname is set to build on
  top of (configured with `branch.<name>.remote` and
  `branch.<name>.merge`).  A missing branchname defaults to the
  current one. These suffixes are also accepted when spelled in uppercase, and
  they mean the same thing no matter the case.

'[<branchname>]@\{push\}', e.g. 'master@\{push\}', '@\{push\}'::
  The suffix '@\{push}' reports the branch "where we would push to" if
  `git push` were run while `branchname` was checked out (or the current
  `HEAD` if no branchname is specified). Since our push destination is
  in a remote repository, of course, we report the local tracking branch
  that corresponds to that branch (i.e., something in `refs/remotes/`).
+
Here's an example to make it more clear:
+
------------------------------
$ git config push.default current
$ git config remote.pushdefault myfork
$ git switch -c mybranch origin/master

$ git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name @{upstream}
refs/remotes/origin/master

$ git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name @{push}
refs/remotes/myfork/mybranch
------------------------------
+
Note in the example that we set up a triangular workflow, where we pull
from one location and push to another. In a non-triangular workflow,
'@\{push}' is the same as '@\{upstream}', and there is no need for it.
+
This suffix is also accepted when spelled in uppercase, and means the same
thing no matter the case.

'<rev>{caret}[<n>]', e.g. 'HEAD{caret}, v1.5.1{caret}0'::
  A suffix '{caret}' to a revision parameter means the first parent of
  that commit object.  '{caret}<n>' means the <n>th parent (i.e.
  '<rev>{caret}'
  is equivalent to '<rev>{caret}1').  As a special rule,
  '<rev>{caret}0' means the commit itself and is used when '<rev>' is the
  object name of a tag object that refers to a commit object.

'<rev>{tilde}[<n>]', e.g. 'HEAD{tilde}, master{tilde}3'::
  A suffix '{tilde}' to a revision parameter means the first parent of
  that commit object.
  A suffix '{tilde}<n>' to a revision parameter means the commit
  object that is the <n>th generation ancestor of the named
  commit object, following only the first parents.  I.e. '<rev>{tilde}3' is
  equivalent to '<rev>{caret}{caret}{caret}' which is equivalent to
  '<rev>{caret}1{caret}1{caret}1'.  See below for an illustration of
  the usage of this form.

'<rev>{caret}{<type>}', e.g. 'v0.99.8{caret}\{commit\}'::
  A suffix '{caret}' followed by an object type name enclosed in
  brace pair means dereference the object at '<rev>' recursively until
  an object of type '<type>' is found or the object cannot be
  dereferenced anymore (in which case, barf).
  For example, if '<rev>' is a commit-ish, '<rev>{caret}\{commit\}'
  describes the corresponding commit object.
  Similarly, if '<rev>' is a tree-ish, '<rev>{caret}\{tree\}'
  describes the corresponding tree object.
  '<rev>{caret}0'
  is a short-hand for '<rev>{caret}\{commit\}'.
+
'<rev>{caret}\{object\}' can be used to make sure '<rev>' names an
object that exists, without requiring '<rev>' to be a tag, and
without dereferencing '<rev>'; because a tag is already an object,
it does not have to be dereferenced even once to get to an object.
+
'<rev>{caret}\{tag\}' can be used to ensure that '<rev>' identifies an
existing tag object.

'<rev>{caret}{}', e.g. 'v0.99.8{caret}{}'::
  A suffix '{caret}' followed by an empty brace pair
  means the object could be a tag,
  and dereference the tag recursively until a non-tag object is
  found.

'<rev>{caret}{/<text>}', e.g. 'HEAD^{/fix nasty bug}'::
  A suffix '{caret}' to a revision parameter, followed by a brace
  pair that contains a text led by a slash,
  is the same as the ':/fix nasty bug' syntax below except that
  it returns the youngest matching commit which is reachable from
  the '<rev>' before '{caret}'.

':/<text>', e.g. ':/fix nasty bug'::
  A colon, followed by a slash, followed by a text, names
  a commit whose commit message matches the specified regular expression.
  This name returns the youngest matching commit which is
  reachable from any ref, including HEAD.
  The regular expression can match any part of the
  commit message. To match messages starting with a string, one can use
  e.g. ':/^foo'. The special sequence ':/!' is reserved for modifiers to what
  is matched. ':/!-foo' performs a negative match, while ':/!!foo' matches a
  literal '!' character, followed by 'foo'. Any other sequence beginning with
  ':/!' is reserved for now.
  Depending on the given text, the shell's word splitting rules might
  require additional quoting.

'<rev>:<path>', e.g. 'HEAD:README', 'master:./README'::
  A suffix ':' followed by a path names the blob or tree
  at the given path in the tree-ish object named by the part
  before the colon.
  A path starting with './' or '../' is relative to the current working directory.
  The given path will be converted to be relative to the working tree's root directory.
  This is most useful to address a blob or tree from a commit or tree that has
  the same tree structure as the working tree.

':[<n>:]<path>', e.g. ':0:README', ':README'::
  A colon, optionally followed by a stage number (0 to 3) and a
  colon, followed by a path, names a blob object in the
  index at the given path. A missing stage number (and the colon
  that follows it) names a stage 0 entry. During a merge, stage
  1 is the common ancestor, stage 2 is the target branch's version
  (typically the current branch), and stage 3 is the version from
  the branch which is being merged.

Here is an illustration, by Jon Loeliger.  Both commit nodes B
and C are parents of commit node A.  Parent commits are ordered
left-to-right.

........................................
G   H   I   J
 \ /     \ /
  D   E   F
   \  |  / \
    \ | /   |
     \|/    |
      B     C
       \   /
        \ /
         A
........................................

    A =      = A^0
    B = A^   = A^1     = A~1
    C =      = A^2
    D = A^^  = A^1^1   = A~2
    E = B^2  = A^^2
    F = B^3  = A^^3
    G = A^^^ = A^1^1^1 = A~3
    H = D^2  = B^^2    = A^^^2  = A~2^2
    I = F^   = B^3^    = A^^3^
    J = F^2  = B^3^2   = A^^3^2


SPECIFYING RANGES
-----------------

History traversing commands such as `git log` operate on a set
of commits, not just a single commit.

For these commands,
specifying a single revision, using the notation described in the
previous section, means the set of commits `reachable` from the given
commit.

Specifying several revisions means the set of commits reachable from
any of the given commits.

A commit's reachable set is the commit itself and the commits in
its ancestry chain.

There are several notations to specify a set of connected commits
(called a "revision range"), illustrated below.


Commit Exclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'{caret}<rev>' (caret) Notation::
 To exclude commits reachable from a commit, a prefix '{caret}'
 notation is used.  E.g. '{caret}r1 r2' means commits reachable
 from 'r2' but exclude the ones reachable from 'r1' (i.e. 'r1' and
 its ancestors).

Dotted Range Notations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The '..' (two-dot) Range Notation::
 The '{caret}r1 r2' set operation appears so often that there is a shorthand
 for it.  When you have two commits 'r1' and 'r2' (named according
 to the syntax explained in SPECIFYING REVISIONS above), you can ask
 for commits that are reachable from r2 excluding those that are reachable
 from r1 by '{caret}r1 r2' and it can be written as 'r1..r2'.

The '...' (three-dot) Symmetric Difference Notation::
 A similar notation 'r1\...r2' is called symmetric difference
 of 'r1' and 'r2' and is defined as
 'r1 r2 --not $(git merge-base --all r1 r2)'.
 It is the set of commits that are reachable from either one of
 'r1' (left side) or 'r2' (right side) but not from both.

In these two shorthand notations, you can omit one end and let it default to HEAD.
For example, 'origin..' is a shorthand for 'origin..HEAD' and asks "What
did I do since I forked from the origin branch?"  Similarly, '..origin'
is a shorthand for 'HEAD..origin' and asks "What did the origin do since
I forked from them?"  Note that '..' would mean 'HEAD..HEAD' which is an
empty range that is both reachable and unreachable from HEAD.

Commands that are specifically designed to take two distinct ranges
(e.g. "git range-diff R1 R2" to compare two ranges) do exist, but
they are exceptions.  Unless otherwise noted, all "git" commands
that operate on a set of commits work on a single revision range.
In other words, writing two "two-dot range notation" next to each
other, e.g.

    $ git log A..B C..D

does *not* specify two revision ranges for most commands.  Instead
it will name a single connected set of commits, i.e. those that are
reachable from either B or D but are reachable from neither A or C.
In a linear history like this:

    ---A---B---o---o---C---D

because A and B are reachable from C, the revision range specified
by these two dotted ranges is a single commit D.


Other <rev>{caret} Parent Shorthand Notations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Three other shorthands exist, particularly useful for merge commits,
for naming a set that is formed by a commit and its parent commits.

The 'r1{caret}@' notation means all parents of 'r1'.

The 'r1{caret}!' notation includes commit 'r1' but excludes all of its parents.
By itself, this notation denotes the single commit 'r1'.

The '<rev>{caret}-[<n>]' notation includes '<rev>' but excludes the <n>th
parent (i.e. a shorthand for '<rev>{caret}<n>..<rev>'), with '<n>' = 1 if
not given. This is typically useful for merge commits where you
can just pass '<commit>{caret}-' to get all the commits in the branch
that was merged in merge commit '<commit>' (including '<commit>'
itself).

While '<rev>{caret}<n>' was about specifying a single commit parent, these
three notations also consider its parents. For example you can say
'HEAD{caret}2{caret}@', however you cannot say 'HEAD{caret}@{caret}2'.

Revision Range Summary
----------------------

'<rev>'::
	Include commits that are reachable from <rev> (i.e. <rev> and its
	ancestors).

'{caret}<rev>'::
	Exclude commits that are reachable from <rev> (i.e. <rev> and its
	ancestors).

'<rev1>..<rev2>'::
	Include commits that are reachable from <rev2> but exclude
	those that are reachable from <rev1>.  When either <rev1> or
	<rev2> is omitted, it defaults to `HEAD`.

'<rev1>\...<rev2>'::
	Include commits that are reachable from either <rev1> or
	<rev2> but exclude those that are reachable from both.  When
	either <rev1> or <rev2> is omitted, it defaults to `HEAD`.

'<rev>{caret}@', e.g. 'HEAD{caret}@'::
  A suffix '{caret}' followed by an at sign is the same as listing
  all parents of '<rev>' (meaning, include anything reachable from
  its parents, but not the commit itself).

'<rev>{caret}!', e.g. 'HEAD{caret}!'::
  A suffix '{caret}' followed by an exclamation mark is the same
  as giving commit '<rev>' and then all its parents prefixed with
  '{caret}' to exclude them (and their ancestors).

'<rev>{caret}-<n>', e.g. 'HEAD{caret}-, HEAD{caret}-2'::
	Equivalent to '<rev>{caret}<n>..<rev>', with '<n>' = 1 if not
	given.

Here are a handful of examples using the Loeliger illustration above,
with each step in the notation's expansion and selection carefully
spelt out:

....
   Args   Expanded arguments    Selected commits
   D                            G H D
   D F                          G H I J D F
   ^G D                         H D
   ^D B                         E I J F B
   ^D B C                       E I J F B C
   C                            I J F C
   B..C   = ^B C                C
   B...C  = B ^F C              G H D E B C
   B^-    = B^..B
	  = ^B^1 B              E I J F B
   C^@    = C^1
	  = F                   I J F
   B^@    = B^1 B^2 B^3
	  = D E F               D G H E F I J
   C^!    = C ^C^@

   B^!    = B ^B^@
	  = B ^B^1 ^B^2 ^B^3
	  = B ^D ^E ^F          B

PARSEOPT
--------

In `--parseopt` mode, 'git rev-parse' helps massaging options to bring to shell
scripts the same facilities C builtins have. It works as an option normalizer
(e.g. splits single switches aggregate values), a bit like `getopt(1)` does.

It takes on the standard input the specification of the options to parse and
understand, and echoes on the standard output a string suitable for `sh(1)` `eval`
to replace the arguments with normalized ones.  In case of error, it outputs
usage on the standard error stream, and exits with code 129.

Note: Make sure you quote the result when passing it to `eval`.  See
below for an example.

Input Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~

'git rev-parse --parseopt' input format is fully text based. It has two parts,
separated by a line that contains only `--`. The lines before the separator
(should be one or more) are used for the usage.
The lines after the separator describe the options.

Each line of options has this format:

------------
<opt-spec><flags>*<arg-hint>? SP+ help LF
------------

`<opt-spec>`::
	its format is the short option character, then the long option name
	separated by a comma. Both parts are not required, though at least one
	is necessary. May not contain any of the `<flags>` characters.
	`h,help`, `dry-run` and `f` are examples of correct `<opt-spec>`.

`<flags>`::
	`<flags>` are of `*`, `=`, `?` or `!`.
	* Use `=` if the option takes an argument.

	* Use `?` to mean that the option takes an optional argument. You
	  probably want to use the `--stuck-long` mode to be able to
	  unambiguously parse the optional argument.

	* Use `*` to mean that this option should not be listed in the usage
	  generated for the `-h` argument. It's shown for `--help-all` as
	  documented in linkgit:gitcli[7].

	* Use `!` to not make the corresponding negated long option available.

`<arg-hint>`::
	`<arg-hint>`, if specified, is used as a name of the argument in the
	help output, for options that take arguments. `<arg-hint>` is
	terminated by the first whitespace.  It is customary to use a
	dash to separate words in a multi-word argument hint.

The remainder of the line, after stripping the spaces, is used
as the help associated to the option.

Blank lines are ignored, and lines that don't match this specification are used
as option group headers (start the line with a space to create such
lines on purpose).

Example
~~~~~~~

------------
OPTS_SPEC="\
some-command [<options>] <args>...

some-command does foo and bar!
--
h,help    show the help

foo       some nifty option --foo
bar=      some cool option --bar with an argument
baz=arg   another cool option --baz with a named argument
qux?path  qux may take a path argument but has meaning by itself

  An option group Header
C?        option C with an optional argument"

eval "$(echo "$OPTS_SPEC" | git rev-parse --parseopt -- "$@" || echo exit $?)"
------------


Usage text
~~~~~~~~~~

When `"$@"` is `-h` or `--help` in the above example, the following
usage text would be shown:

------------
usage: some-command [<options>] <args>...

    some-command does foo and bar!

    -h, --help            show the help
    --foo                 some nifty option --foo
    --bar ...             some cool option --bar with an argument
    --baz <arg>           another cool option --baz with a named argument
    --qux[=<path>]        qux may take a path argument but has meaning by itself

An option group Header
    -C[...]               option C with an optional argument
------------

SQ-QUOTE
--------

In `--sq-quote` mode, 'git rev-parse' echoes on the standard output a
single line suitable for `sh(1)` `eval`. This line is made by
normalizing the arguments following `--sq-quote`. Nothing other than
quoting the arguments is done.

If you want command input to still be interpreted as usual by
'git rev-parse' before the output is shell quoted, see the `--sq`
option.

Example
~~~~~~~

------------
$ cat >your-git-script.sh <<\EOF
#!/bin/sh
args=$(git rev-parse --sq-quote "$@")   # quote user-supplied arguments
command="git frotz -n24 $args"          # and use it inside a handcrafted
					# command line
eval "$command"
EOF

$ sh your-git-script.sh "a b'c"
------------

EXAMPLES
--------

* Print the object name of the current commit:
+
------------
$ git rev-parse --verify HEAD
------------

* Print the commit object name from the revision in the $REV shell variable:
+
------------
$ git rev-parse --verify --end-of-options $REV^{commit}
------------
+
This will error out if $REV is empty or not a valid revision.

* Similar to above:
+
------------
$ git rev-parse --default master --verify --end-of-options $REV
------------
+
but if $REV is empty, the commit object name from master will be printed.
