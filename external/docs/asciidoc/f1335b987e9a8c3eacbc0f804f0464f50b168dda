NAME

git-merge - Join two or more development histories together


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git merge' [-n] [--stat] [--no-commit] [--squash] [--[no-]edit]
	[--no-verify] [-s <strategy>] [-X <strategy-option>] [-S[<keyid>]]
	[--[no-]allow-unrelated-histories]
	[--[no-]rerere-autoupdate] [-m <msg>] [-F <file>] [<commit>...]
'git merge' (--continue | --abort | --quit)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their
histories diverged from the current branch) into the current
branch.  This command is used by 'git pull' to incorporate changes
from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes
from one branch into another.

Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
"`master`":

------------
	  A---B---C topic
	 /
    D---E---F---G master
------------

Then "`git merge topic`" will replay the changes made on the
`topic` branch since it diverged from `master` (i.e., `E`) until
its current commit (`C`) on top of `master`, and record the result
in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and
a log message from the user describing the changes.

------------
	  A---B---C topic
	 /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master
------------

The second syntax ("`git merge --abort`") can only be run after the
merge has resulted in conflicts. 'git merge --abort' will abort the
merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However,
if there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and
especially if those changes were further modified after the merge
was started), 'git merge --abort' will in some cases be unable to
reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:

*Warning*: Running 'git merge' with non-trivial uncommitted changes is
discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to
back out of in the case of a conflict.

The third syntax ("`git merge --continue`") can only be run after the
merge has resulted in conflicts.

OPTIONS
-------
:git-merge: 1

--commit::
--no-commit::
	Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can
	be used to override --no-commit.
ifdef::git-pull[]
	Only useful when merging.
endif::git-pull[]
+
With --no-commit perform the merge and stop just before creating
a merge commit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further
tweak the merge result before committing.
+
Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and
therefore there is no way to stop those merges with --no-commit.
Thus, if you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated
by the merge command, use --no-ff with --no-commit.

--edit::
-e::
--no-edit::
	Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to
	further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user
	can explain and justify the merge. The `--no-edit` option can be
	used to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally
	discouraged).
ifndef::git-pull[]
The `--edit` (or `-e`) option is still useful if you are
giving a draft message with the `-m` option from the command line
and want to edit it in the editor.
endif::git-pull[]
+
Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the
user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor opened when
they run `git merge`. To make it easier to adjust such scripts to the
updated behaviour, the environment variable `GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT` can be
set to `no` at the beginning of them.

--cleanup=<mode>::
	This option determines how the merge message will be cleaned up before
	committing. See linkgit:git-commit[1] for more details. In addition, if
	the '<mode>' is given a value of `scissors`, scissors will be appended
	to `MERGE_MSG` before being passed on to the commit machinery in the
	case of a merge conflict.

ifdef::git-merge[]
--ff::
--no-ff::
--ff-only::
	Specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in history is
	already a descendant of the current history.  `--ff` is the
	default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag
	that is not stored in its natural place in the `refs/tags/`
	hierarchy, in which case `--no-ff` is assumed.
endif::git-merge[]
ifdef::git-pull[]
--ff-only::
	Only update to the new history if there is no divergent local
	history.  This is the default when no method for reconciling
	divergent histories is provided (via the --rebase=* flags).

--ff::
--no-ff::
	When merging rather than rebasing, specifies how a merge is
	handled when the merged-in history is already a descendant of
	the current history.  If merging is requested, `--ff` is the
	default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag
	that is not stored in its natural place in the `refs/tags/`
	hierarchy, in which case `--no-ff` is assumed.
endif::git-pull[]
+
With `--ff`, when possible resolve the merge as a fast-forward (only
update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do not create a
merge commit).  When not possible (when the merged-in history is not a
descendant of the current history), create a merge commit.
+
With `--no-ff`, create a merge commit in all cases, even when the merge
could instead be resolved as a fast-forward.
ifdef::git-merge[]
+
With `--ff-only`, resolve the merge as a fast-forward when possible.
When not possible, refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status.
endif::git-merge[]

-S[<keyid>]::
--gpg-sign[=<keyid>]::
--no-gpg-sign::
	GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The `keyid` argument is
	optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified,
	it must be stuck to the option without a space. `--no-gpg-sign`
	is useful to countermand both `commit.gpgSign` configuration variable,
	and earlier `--gpg-sign`.

--log[=<n>]::
--no-log::
	In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
	one-line descriptions from at most <n> actual commits that are being
	merged. See also linkgit:git-fmt-merge-msg[1].
ifdef::git-pull[]
	Only useful when merging.
endif::git-pull[]
+
With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the
actual commits being merged.

ifdef::git-commit[]
-s::
endif::git-commit[]
--signoff::
--no-signoff::
	Add a `Signed-off-by` trailer by the committer at the end of the commit
	log message.  The meaning of a signoff depends on the project
	to which you're committing.  For example, it may certify that
	the committer has the rights to submit the work under the
	project's license or agrees to some contributor representation,
	such as a Developer Certificate of Origin.
	(See http://developercertificate.org for the one used by the
	Linux kernel and Git projects.)  Consult the documentation or
	leadership of the project to which you're contributing to
	understand how the signoffs are used in that project.
+
The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier --signoff
option on the command line.


--stat::
-n::
--no-stat::
	Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also
	controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.
+
With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the
merge.

--squash::
--no-squash::
	Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge
	happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually
	make a commit, move the `HEAD`, or record `$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD`
	(to cause the next `git commit` command to create a merge
	commit).  This allows you to create a single commit on top of
	the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another
	branch (or more in case of an octopus).
+
With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This
option can be used to override --squash.
+
With --squash, --commit is not allowed, and will fail.
ifdef::git-pull[]
+
Only useful when merging.
endif::git-pull[]

--[no-]verify::
	By default, the pre-merge and commit-msg hooks are run.
	When `--no-verify` is given, these are bypassed.
	See also linkgit:githooks[5].
ifdef::git-pull[]
	Only useful when merging.
endif::git-pull[]

-s <strategy>::
--strategy=<strategy>::
	Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than
	once to specify them in the order they should be tried.
	If there is no `-s` option, a built-in list of strategies
	is used instead (`ort` when merging a single head,
	`octopus` otherwise).

-X <option>::
--strategy-option=<option>::
	Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
	strategy.

--verify-signatures::
--no-verify-signatures::
	Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is
	signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the
	default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by
	a trusted key.  If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed
	with a valid key, the merge is aborted.
ifdef::git-pull[]
+
Only useful when merging.
endif::git-pull[]

--summary::
--no-summary::
	Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and will be
	removed in the future.

ifndef::git-pull[]
-q::
--quiet::
	Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.

-v::
--verbose::
	Be verbose.

--progress::
--no-progress::
	Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
	progress is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal.
	Note that not all merge strategies may support progress
	reporting.

endif::git-pull[]

--autostash::
--no-autostash::
	Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the operation
	begins, record it in the special ref `MERGE_AUTOSTASH`
	and apply it after the operation ends.  This means
	that you can run the operation on a dirty worktree.  However, use
	with care: the final stash application after a successful
	merge might result in non-trivial conflicts.

--allow-unrelated-histories::
	By default, `git merge` command refuses to merge histories
	that do not share a common ancestor.  This option can be
	used to override this safety when merging histories of two
	projects that started their lives independently. As that is
	a very rare occasion, no configuration variable to enable
	this by default exists and will not be added.
ifdef::git-pull[]
+
Only useful when merging.
endif::git-pull[]


-m <msg>::
	Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in
	case one is created).
+
If `--log` is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged
will be appended to the specified message.
+
The 'git fmt-merge-msg' command can be
used to give a good default for automated 'git merge'
invocations. The automated message can include the branch description.

-F <file>::
--file=<file>::
	Read the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in
	case one is created).
+
If `--log` is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged
will be appended to the specified message.

--rerere-autoupdate::
--no-rerere-autoupdate::
	Allow the rerere mechanism to update the index with the
	result of auto-conflict resolution if possible.

--overwrite-ignore::
--no-overwrite-ignore::
	Silently overwrite ignored files from the merge result. This
	is the default behavior. Use `--no-overwrite-ignore` to abort.

--abort::
	Abort the current conflict resolution process, and
	try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. If an autostash entry is
	present, apply it to the worktree.
+
If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge
started, 'git merge --abort' will in some cases be unable to
reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always
commit or stash your changes before running 'git merge'.
+
'git merge --abort' is equivalent to 'git reset --merge' when
`MERGE_HEAD` is present unless `MERGE_AUTOSTASH` is also present in
which case 'git merge --abort' applies the stash entry to the worktree
whereas 'git reset --merge' will save the stashed changes in the stash
list.

--quit::
	Forget about the current merge in progress. Leave the index
	and the working tree as-is. If `MERGE_AUTOSTASH` is present, the
	stash entry will be saved to the stash list.

--continue::
	After a 'git merge' stops due to conflicts you can conclude the
	merge by running 'git merge --continue' (see "HOW TO RESOLVE
	CONFLICTS" section below).

<commit>...::
	Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our branch.
	Specifying more than one commit will create a merge with
	more than two parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).
+
If no commit is given from the command line, merge the remote-tracking
branches that the current branch is configured to use as its upstream.
See also the configuration section of this manual page.
+
When `FETCH_HEAD` (and no other commit) is specified, the branches
recorded in the `.git/FETCH_HEAD` file by the previous invocation
of `git fetch` for merging are merged to the current branch.


PRE-MERGE CHECKS
----------------

Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in
good shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if
there are conflicts.  See also linkgit:git-stash[1].
'git pull' and 'git merge' will stop without doing anything when
local uncommitted changes overlap with files that 'git pull'/'git
merge' may need to update.

To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit,
'git pull' and 'git merge' will also abort if there are any changes
registered in the index relative to the `HEAD` commit.  (Special
narrow exceptions to this rule may exist depending on which merge
strategy is in use, but generally, the index must match HEAD.)

If all named commits are already ancestors of `HEAD`, 'git merge'
will exit early with the message "Already up to date."

FAST-FORWARD MERGE
------------------

Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit.
This is the most common case especially when invoked from 'git
pull': you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed
no local changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream
revision.  In this case, a new commit is not needed to store the
combined history; instead, the `HEAD` (along with the index) is
updated to point at the named commit, without creating an extra
merge commit.

This behavior can be suppressed with the `--no-ff` option.

TRUE MERGE
----------

Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be
merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them
as its parents.

A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be
merged is committed, and your `HEAD`, index, and working tree are
updated to it.  It is possible to have modifications in the working
tree as long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.

When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
happens:

1. The `HEAD` pointer stays the same.
2. The `MERGE_HEAD` ref is set to point to the other branch head.
3. Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and
   in your working tree.
4. For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three
   versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor,
   stage 2 from `HEAD`, and stage 3 from `MERGE_HEAD` (you
   can inspect the stages with `git ls-files -u`).  The working
   tree files contain the result of the "merge" program; i.e. 3-way
   merge results with familiar conflict markers `<<<` `===` `>>>`.
5. No other changes are made.  In particular, the local
   modifications you had before you started merge will stay the
   same and the index entries for them stay as they were,
   i.e. matching `HEAD`.

If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and
want to start over, you can recover with `git merge --abort`.

MERGING TAG
-----------

When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always
creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and
the commit message template is prepared with the tag message.
Additionally, if the tag is signed, the signature check is reported
as a comment in the message template. See also linkgit:git-tag[1].

When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the commit
that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream
release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.

In such a case, you can "unwrap" the tag yourself before feeding it
to `git merge`, or pass `--ff-only` when you do not have any work on
your own. e.g.

----
git fetch origin
git merge v1.2.3^0
git merge --ff-only v1.2.3
----


HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED
---------------------------

During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the result
of the merge.  Among the changes made to the common ancestor's version,
non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file while the
other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in the
final result verbatim.  When both sides made changes to the same area,
however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the other, and asks you to
resolve it by leaving what both sides did to that area.

By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the "merge" program
from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted hunk, like this:

------------
Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
<<<<<<< yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.
=======
Git makes conflict resolution easy.
>>>>>>> theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.
------------

The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with markers
`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.  The part before the `=======`
is typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.

The default format does not show what the original said in the conflicting
area.  You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and replaced with
Barbie's remark on your side.  The only thing you can tell is that your
side wants to say it is hard and you'd prefer to go shopping, while the
other side wants to claim it is easy.

An alternative style can be used by setting the "merge.conflictStyle"
configuration variable to "diff3".  In "diff3" style, the above conflict
may look like this:

------------
Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
<<<<<<< yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.
|||||||
Conflict resolution is hard.
=======
Git makes conflict resolution easy.
>>>>>>> theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.
------------

In addition to the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers, it uses
another `|||||||` marker that is followed by the original text.  You can
tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side simply gave in to
that statement and gave up, while the other side tried to have a more
positive attitude.  You can sometimes come up with a better resolution by
viewing the original.


HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS
------------------------

After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:

 * Decide not to merge.  The only clean-ups you need are to reset
   the index file to the `HEAD` commit to reverse 2. and to clean
   up working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; `git merge --abort`
   can be used for this.

 * Resolve the conflicts.  Git will mark the conflicts in
   the working tree.  Edit the files into shape and
   'git add' them to the index.  Use 'git commit' or
   'git merge --continue' to seal the deal. The latter command
   checks whether there is a (interrupted) merge in progress
   before calling 'git commit'.

You can work through the conflict with a number of tools:

 * Use a mergetool.  `git mergetool` to launch a graphical
   mergetool which will work you through the merge.

 * Look at the diffs.  `git diff` will show a three-way diff,
   highlighting changes from both the `HEAD` and `MERGE_HEAD`
   versions.

 * Look at the diffs from each branch. `git log --merge -p <path>`
   will show diffs first for the `HEAD` version and then the
   `MERGE_HEAD` version.

 * Look at the originals.  `git show :1:filename` shows the
   common ancestor, `git show :2:filename` shows the `HEAD`
   version, and `git show :3:filename` shows the `MERGE_HEAD`
   version.


EXAMPLES
--------

* Merge branches `fixes` and `enhancements` on top of
  the current branch, making an octopus merge:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ git merge fixes enhancements
------------------------------------------------

* Merge branch `obsolete` into the current branch, using `ours`
  merge strategy:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ git merge -s ours obsolete
------------------------------------------------

* Merge branch `maint` into the current branch, but do not make
  a new commit automatically:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ git merge --no-commit maint
------------------------------------------------
+
This can be used when you want to include further changes to the
merge, or want to write your own merge commit message.
+
You should refrain from abusing this option to sneak substantial
changes into a merge commit.  Small fixups like bumping
release/version name would be acceptable.


MERGE STRATEGIES
----------------

The merge mechanism (`git merge` and `git pull` commands) allows the
backend 'merge strategies' to be chosen with `-s` option.  Some strategies
can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving `-X<option>`
arguments to `git merge` and/or `git pull`.

ort::
	This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one
	branch.  This strategy can only resolve two heads using a
	3-way merge algorithm.  When there is more than one common
	ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged
	tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference
	tree for the 3-way merge.  This has been reported to result in
	fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done
	on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel
	development history.  Additionally this strategy can detect
	and handle merges involving renames.  It does not make use of
	detected copies.  The name for this algorithm is an acronym
	("Ostensibly Recursive's Twin") and came from the fact that it
	was written as a replacement for the previous default
	algorithm, `recursive`.
+
The 'ort' strategy can take the following options:

ours;;
	This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by
	favoring 'our' version.  Changes from the other tree that do not
	conflict with our side are reflected in the merge result.
	For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from our side.
+
This should not be confused with the 'ours' merge strategy, which does not
even look at what the other tree contains at all.  It discards everything
the other tree did, declaring 'our' history contains all that happened in it.

theirs;;
	This is the opposite of 'ours'; note that, unlike 'ours', there is
	no 'theirs' merge strategy to confuse this merge option with.

ignore-space-change;;
ignore-all-space;;
ignore-space-at-eol;;
ignore-cr-at-eol;;
	Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as
	unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge.  Whitespace
	changes mixed with other changes to a line are not ignored.
	See also linkgit:git-diff[1] `-b`, `-w`,
	`--ignore-space-at-eol`, and `--ignore-cr-at-eol`.
+
* If 'their' version only introduces whitespace changes to a line,
  'our' version is used;
* If 'our' version introduces whitespace changes but 'their'
  version includes a substantial change, 'their' version is used;
* Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.

renormalize;;
	This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages
	of a file when resolving a three-way merge.  This option is
	meant to be used when merging branches with different clean
	filters or end-of-line normalization rules.  See "Merging
	branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes" in
	linkgit:gitattributes[5] for details.

no-renormalize;;
	Disables the `renormalize` option.  This overrides the
	`merge.renormalize` configuration variable.

find-renames[=<n>];;
	Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity
	threshold.  This is the default. This overrides the
	'merge.renames' configuration variable.
	See also linkgit:git-diff[1] `--find-renames`.

rename-threshold=<n>;;
	Deprecated synonym for `find-renames=<n>`.

subtree[=<path>];;
	This option is a more advanced form of 'subtree' strategy, where
	the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to
	match with each other when merging.  Instead, the specified path
	is prefixed (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of
	two trees to match.

recursive::
	This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
	algorithm.  When there is more than one common
	ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a
	merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
	the reference tree for the 3-way merge.  This has been
	reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without
	causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits
	taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
	Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving
	renames.  It does not make use of detected copies.  This was
	the default strategy for resolving two heads from Git v0.99.9k
	until v2.33.0.
+
The 'recursive' strategy takes the same options as 'ort'.  However,
there are three additional options that 'ort' ignores (not documented
above) that are potentially useful with the 'recursive' strategy:

patience;;
	Deprecated synonym for `diff-algorithm=patience`.

diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers];;
	Use a different diff algorithm while merging, which can help
	avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching lines
	(such as braces from distinct functions).  See also
	linkgit:git-diff[1] `--diff-algorithm`.  Note that `ort`
	specifically uses `diff-algorithm=histogram`, while `recursive`
	defaults to the `diff.algorithm` config setting.

no-renames;;
	Turn off rename detection. This overrides the `merge.renames`
	configuration variable.
	See also linkgit:git-diff[1] `--no-renames`.

resolve::
	This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch
	and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge
	algorithm.  It tries to carefully detect criss-cross
	merge ambiguities.  It does not handle renames.

octopus::
	This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do
	a complex merge that needs manual resolution.  It is
	primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch
	heads together.  This is the default merge strategy when
	pulling or merging more than one branch.

ours::
	This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the
	merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively
	ignoring all changes from all other branches.  It is meant to
	be used to supersede old development history of side
	branches.  Note that this is different from the -Xours option to
	the 'recursive' merge strategy.

subtree::
	This is a modified `ort` strategy. When merging trees A and
	B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to
	match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at
	the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common
	ancestor tree.

With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, 'ort'),
if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the
branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people find
this behavior confusing.  It occurs because only the heads and the merge base
are considered when performing a merge, not the individual commits.  The merge
algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as no change at all, and
substitutes the changed version instead.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
merge.conflictStyle::
	Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out to
	working tree files upon merge.  The default is "merge", which
	shows a `<<<<<<<` conflict marker, changes made by one side,
	a `=======` marker, changes made by the other side, and then
	a `>>>>>>>` marker.  An alternate style, "diff3", adds a `|||||||`
	marker and the original text before the `=======` marker.

merge.defaultToUpstream::
	If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the upstream
	branches configured for the current branch by using their last
	observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches.
	The values of the `branch.<current branch>.merge` that name the
	branches at the remote named by `branch.<current branch>.remote`
	are consulted, and then they are mapped via `remote.<remote>.fetch`
	to their corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of
	these tracking branches are merged. Defaults to true.

merge.ff::
	By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging
	a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the
	tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to `false`,
	this variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such
	a case (equivalent to giving the `--no-ff` option from the command
	line). When set to `only`, only such fast-forward merges are
	allowed (equivalent to giving the `--ff-only` option from the
	command line).

merge.verifySignatures::
	If true, this is equivalent to the --verify-signatures command
	line option. See linkgit:git-merge[1] for details.

merge.branchdesc::
	In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
	the branch description text associated with them.  Defaults
	to false.

merge.log::
	In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at
	most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the
	actual commits that are being merged.  Defaults to false, and
	true is a synonym for 20.

merge.suppressDest::
	By adding a glob that matches the names of integration
	branches to this multi-valued configuration variable, the
	default merge message computed for merges into these
	integration branches will omit "into <branch name>" from
	its title.
+
An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list
of globs accumulated from previous configuration entries.
When there is no `merge.suppressDest` variable defined, the
default value of `master` is used for backward compatibility.


merge.renameLimit::
	The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of
	rename detection during a merge.  If not specified, defaults
	to the value of diff.renameLimit.  If neither
	merge.renameLimit nor diff.renameLimit are specified,
	currently defaults to 7000.  This setting has no effect if
	rename detection is turned off.

merge.renames::
	Whether Git detects renames.  If set to "false", rename detection
	is disabled. If set to "true", basic rename detection is enabled.
	Defaults to the value of diff.renames.

merge.directoryRenames::
	Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what happens at
	merge time to new files added to a directory on one side of
	history when that directory was renamed on the other side of
	history.  If merge.directoryRenames is set to "false", directory
	rename detection is disabled, meaning that such new files will be
	left behind in the old directory.  If set to "true", directory
	rename detection is enabled, meaning that such new files will be
	moved into the new directory.  If set to "conflict", a conflict
	will be reported for such paths.  If merge.renames is false,
	merge.directoryRenames is ignored and treated as false.  Defaults
	to "conflict".

merge.renormalize::
	Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the
	repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record
	text files with CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line
	endings).  In such a repository, Git can convert the data
	recorded in commits to a canonical form before performing a
	merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts.  For more information,
	see section "Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
	attributes" in linkgit:gitattributes[5].

merge.stat::
	Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the merge result
	at the end of the merge.  True by default.

merge.autoStash::
	When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash entry
	before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation
	ends.  This means that you can run merge on a dirty worktree.
	However, use with care: the final stash application after a
	successful merge might result in non-trivial conflicts.
	This option can be overridden by the `--no-autostash` and
	`--autostash` options of linkgit:git-merge[1].
	Defaults to false.

merge.tool::
	Controls which merge tool is used by linkgit:git-mergetool[1].
	The list below shows the valid built-in values.
	Any other value is treated as a custom merge tool and requires
	that a corresponding mergetool.<tool>.cmd variable is defined.

merge.guitool::
	Controls which merge tool is used by linkgit:git-mergetool[1] when the
	-g/--gui flag is specified. The list below shows the valid built-in values.
	Any other value is treated as a custom merge tool and requires that a
	corresponding mergetool.<guitool>.cmd variable is defined.

merge.verbosity::
	Controls the amount of output shown by the recursive merge
	strategy.  Level 0 outputs nothing except a final error
	message if conflicts were detected. Level 1 outputs only
	conflicts, 2 outputs conflicts and file changes.  Level 5 and
	above outputs debugging information.  The default is level 2.
	Can be overridden by the `GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY` environment variable.

merge.<driver>.name::
	Defines a human-readable name for a custom low-level
	merge driver.  See linkgit:gitattributes[5] for details.

merge.<driver>.driver::
	Defines the command that implements a custom low-level
	merge driver.  See linkgit:gitattributes[5] for details.

merge.<driver>.recursive::
	Names a low-level merge driver to be used when
	performing an internal merge between common ancestors.
	See linkgit:gitattributes[5] for details.


branch.<name>.mergeOptions::
	Sets default options for merging into branch <name>. The syntax and
	supported options are the same as those of 'git merge', but option
	values containing whitespace characters are currently not supported.
