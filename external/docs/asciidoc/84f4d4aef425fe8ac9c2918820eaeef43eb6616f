NAME
----
git-gc - Cleanup unnecessary files and optimize the local repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git gc' [--aggressive] [--auto] [--quiet] [--prune=<date> | --no-prune] [--force] [--keep-largest-pack]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository,
such as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase
performance), removing unreachable objects which may have been
created from prior invocations of 'git add', packing refs, pruning
reflog, rerere metadata or stale working trees. May also update ancillary
indexes such as the commit-graph.

When common porcelain operations that create objects are run, they
will check whether the repository has grown substantially since the
last maintenance, and if so run `git gc` automatically. See `gc.auto`
below for how to disable this behavior.

Running `git gc` manually should only be needed when adding objects to
a repository without regularly running such porcelain commands, to do
a one-off repository optimization, or e.g. to clean up a suboptimal
mass-import. See the "PACKFILE OPTIMIZATION" section in
linkgit:git-fast-import[1] for more details on the import case.

OPTIONS
-------

--aggressive::
	Usually 'git gc' runs very quickly while providing good disk
	space utilization and performance.  This option will cause
	'git gc' to more aggressively optimize the repository at the expense
	of taking much more time.  The effects of this optimization are
	mostly persistent. See the "AGGRESSIVE" section below for details.

--auto::
	With this option, 'git gc' checks whether any housekeeping is
	required; if not, it exits without performing any work.
+
See the `gc.auto` option in the "CONFIGURATION" section below for how
this heuristic works.
+
Once housekeeping is triggered by exceeding the limits of
configuration options such as `gc.auto` and `gc.autoPackLimit`, all
other housekeeping tasks (e.g. rerere, working trees, reflog...) will
be performed as well.


--prune=<date>::
	Prune loose objects older than date (default is 2 weeks ago,
	overridable by the config variable `gc.pruneExpire`).
	--prune=now prunes loose objects regardless of their age and
	increases the risk of corruption if another process is writing to
	the repository concurrently; see "NOTES" below. --prune is on by
	default.

--no-prune::
	Do not prune any loose objects.

--quiet::
	Suppress all progress reports.

--force::
	Force `git gc` to run even if there may be another `git gc`
	instance running on this repository.

--keep-largest-pack::
	All packs except the largest pack and those marked with a
	`.keep` files are consolidated into a single pack. When this
	option is used, `gc.bigPackThreshold` is ignored.

AGGRESSIVE
----------

When the `--aggressive` option is supplied, linkgit:git-repack[1] will
be invoked with the `-f` flag, which in turn will pass
`--no-reuse-delta` to linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]. This will throw
away any existing deltas and re-compute them, at the expense of
spending much more time on the repacking.

The effects of this are mostly persistent, e.g. when packs and loose
objects are coalesced into one another pack the existing deltas in
that pack might get re-used, but there are also various cases where we
might pick a sub-optimal delta from a newer pack instead.

Furthermore, supplying `--aggressive` will tweak the `--depth` and
`--window` options passed to linkgit:git-repack[1]. See the
`gc.aggressiveDepth` and `gc.aggressiveWindow` settings below. By
using a larger window size we're more likely to find more optimal
deltas.

It's probably not worth it to use this option on a given repository
without running tailored performance benchmarks on it. It takes a lot
more time, and the resulting space/delta optimization may or may not
be worth it. Not using this at all is the right trade-off for most
users and their repositories.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The below documentation is the same as what's found in
linkgit:git-config[1]:

gc.aggressiveDepth::
	The depth parameter used in the delta compression
	algorithm used by 'git gc --aggressive'.  This defaults
	to 50, which is the default for the `--depth` option when
	`--aggressive` isn't in use.
+
See the documentation for the `--depth` option in
linkgit:git-repack[1] for more details.

gc.aggressiveWindow::
	The window size parameter used in the delta compression
	algorithm used by 'git gc --aggressive'.  This defaults
	to 250, which is a much more aggressive window size than
	the default `--window` of 10.
+
See the documentation for the `--window` option in
linkgit:git-repack[1] for more details.

gc.auto::
	When there are approximately more than this many loose
	objects in the repository, `git gc --auto` will pack them.
	Some Porcelain commands use this command to perform a
	light-weight garbage collection from time to time.  The
	default value is 6700.
+
Setting this to 0 disables not only automatic packing based on the
number of loose objects, but any other heuristic `git gc --auto` will
otherwise use to determine if there's work to do, such as
`gc.autoPackLimit`.

gc.autoPackLimit::
	When there are more than this many packs that are not
	marked with `*.keep` file in the repository, `git gc
	--auto` consolidates them into one larger pack.  The
	default value is 50.  Setting this to 0 disables it.
	Setting `gc.auto` to 0 will also disable this.
+
See the `gc.bigPackThreshold` configuration variable below. When in
use, it'll affect how the auto pack limit works.

gc.autoDetach::
	Make `git gc --auto` return immediately and run in background
	if the system supports it. Default is true.

gc.bigPackThreshold::
	If non-zero, all packs larger than this limit are kept when
	`git gc` is run. This is very similar to `--keep-largest-pack`
	except that all packs that meet the threshold are kept, not
	just the largest pack. Defaults to zero. Common unit suffixes of
	'k', 'm', or 'g' are supported.
+
Note that if the number of kept packs is more than gc.autoPackLimit,
this configuration variable is ignored, all packs except the base pack
will be repacked. After this the number of packs should go below
gc.autoPackLimit and gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected again.
+
If the amount of memory estimated for `git repack` to run smoothly is
not available and `gc.bigPackThreshold` is not set, the largest pack
will also be excluded (this is the equivalent of running `git gc` with
`--keep-largest-pack`).

gc.writeCommitGraph::
	If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when
	linkgit:git-gc[1] is run. When using `git gc --auto`
	the commit-graph will be updated if housekeeping is
	required. Default is true. See linkgit:git-commit-graph[1]
	for details.

gc.logExpiry::
	If the file gc.log exists, then `git gc --auto` will print
	its content and exit with status zero instead of running
	unless that file is more than 'gc.logExpiry' old.  Default is
	"1.day".  See `gc.pruneExpire` for more ways to specify its
	value.

gc.packRefs::
	Running `git pack-refs` in a repository renders it
	unclonable by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb
	transports such as HTTP.  This variable determines whether
	'git gc' runs `git pack-refs`. This can be set to `notbare`
	to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can be set to a
	boolean value.  The default is `true`.

gc.pruneExpire::
	When 'git gc' is run, it will call 'prune --expire 2.weeks.ago'.
	Override the grace period with this config variable.  The value
	"now" may be used to disable this grace period and always prune
	unreachable objects immediately, or "never" may be used to
	suppress pruning.  This feature helps prevent corruption when
	'git gc' runs concurrently with another process writing to the
	repository; see the "NOTES" section of linkgit:git-gc[1].

gc.worktreePruneExpire::
	When 'git gc' is run, it calls
	'git worktree prune --expire 3.months.ago'.
	This config variable can be used to set a different grace
	period. The value "now" may be used to disable the grace
	period and prune `$GIT_DIR/worktrees` immediately, or "never"
	may be used to suppress pruning.

gc.reflogExpire::
gc.<pattern>.reflogExpire::
	'git reflog expire' removes reflog entries older than
	this time; defaults to 90 days. The value "now" expires all
	entries immediately, and "never" suppresses expiration
	altogether. With "<pattern>" (e.g.
	"refs/stash") in the middle the setting applies only to
	the refs that match the <pattern>.

gc.reflogExpireUnreachable::
gc.<pattern>.reflogExpireUnreachable::
	'git reflog expire' removes reflog entries older than
	this time and are not reachable from the current tip;
	defaults to 30 days. The value "now" expires all entries
	immediately, and "never" suppresses expiration altogether.
	With "<pattern>" (e.g. "refs/stash")
	in the middle, the setting applies only to the refs that
	match the <pattern>.
+
These types of entries are generally created as a result of using `git
commit --amend` or `git rebase` and are the commits prior to the amend
or rebase occurring.  Since these changes are not part of the current
project most users will want to expire them sooner, which is why the
default is more aggressive than `gc.reflogExpire`.

gc.rerereResolved::
	Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are
	kept for this many days when 'git rerere gc' is run.
	You can also use more human-readable "1.month.ago", etc.
	The default is 60 days.  See linkgit:git-rerere[1].

gc.rerereUnresolved::
	Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are
	kept for this many days when 'git rerere gc' is run.
	You can also use more human-readable "1.month.ago", etc.
	The default is 15 days.  See linkgit:git-rerere[1].


NOTES
-----

'git gc' tries very hard not to delete objects that are referenced
anywhere in your repository. In particular, it will keep not only
objects referenced by your current set of branches and tags, but also
objects referenced by the index, remote-tracking branches, notes saved
by 'git notes' under refs/notes/, reflogs (which may reference commits
in branches that were later amended or rewound), and anything else in
the refs/* namespace.  If you are expecting some objects to be deleted
and they aren't, check all of those locations and decide whether it
makes sense in your case to remove those references.

On the other hand, when 'git gc' runs concurrently with another process,
there is a risk of it deleting an object that the other process is using
but hasn't created a reference to. This may just cause the other process
to fail or may corrupt the repository if the other process later adds a
reference to the deleted object. Git has two features that significantly
mitigate this problem:

. Any object with modification time newer than the `--prune` date is kept,
  along with everything reachable from it.

. Most operations that add an object to the database update the
  modification time of the object if it is already present so that #1
  applies.

However, these features fall short of a complete solution, so users who
run commands concurrently have to live with some risk of corruption (which
seems to be low in practice).

HOOKS
-----

The 'git gc --auto' command will run the 'pre-auto-gc' hook.  See
linkgit:githooks[5] for more information.
