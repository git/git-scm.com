git-fetch(1)
============

NAME
----
git-fetch - Download objects and refs from another repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git fetch' [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>...]]
'git fetch' [<options>] <group>
'git fetch' --multiple [<options>] [(<repository> | <group>)...]
'git fetch' --all [<options>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Fetches named heads or tags from one or more other repositories,
along with the objects necessary to complete them.

The ref names and their object names of fetched refs are stored
in `.git/FETCH_HEAD`.  This information is left for a later merge
operation done by 'git merge'.

By default, tags are auto-followed.  This means that when fetching
from a remote, any tags on the remote that point to objects that exist
in the local repository are fetched.  The effect is to fetch tags that
point at branches that you are interested in.  This default behavior
can be changed by using the --tags or --no-tags options, by
configuring remote.<name>.tagopt, or by using a refspec that fetches
tags explicitly.

'git fetch' can fetch from either a single named repository,
or from several repositories at once if <group> is given and
there is a remotes.<group> entry in the configuration file.
(See linkgit:git-config[1]).

When no remote is specified, by default the `origin` remote will be used,
unless there's an upstream branch configured for the current branch.

OPTIONS
-------
--all::
	Fetch all remotes.

-a::
--append::
	Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the
	existing contents of `.git/FETCH_HEAD`.  Without this
	option old data in `.git/FETCH_HEAD` will be overwritten.

--depth=<depth>::
	Deepen or shorten the history of a 'shallow' repository created by
	`git clone` with `--depth=<depth>` option (see linkgit:git-clone[1])
	to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote
	branch history. Tags for the deepened commits are not fetched.

--unshallow::
	If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow
	repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations
	imposed by shallow repositories.
+
If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that
the current repository has the same history as the source repository.

--update-shallow::
	By default when fetching from a shallow repository,
	`git fetch` refuses refs that require updating
	.git/shallow. This option updates .git/shallow and accept such
	refs.

ifndef::git-pull[]
--dry-run::
	Show what would be done, without making any changes.
endif::git-pull[]

-f::
--force::
	When 'git fetch' is used with `<rbranch>:<lbranch>`
	refspec, it refuses to update the local branch
	`<lbranch>` unless the remote branch `<rbranch>` it
	fetches is a descendant of `<lbranch>`.  This option
	overrides that check.

-k::
--keep::
	Keep downloaded pack.

ifndef::git-pull[]
--multiple::
	Allow several <repository> and <group> arguments to be
	specified. No <refspec>s may be specified.

-p::
--prune::
	After fetching, remove any remote-tracking references that no
	longer exist on the remote.  Tags are not subject to pruning
	if they are fetched only because of the default tag
	auto-following or due to a --tags option.  However, if tags
	are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the command
	line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote
	was cloned with the --mirror option), then they are also
	subject to pruning.
endif::git-pull[]

ifndef::git-pull[]
-n::
endif::git-pull[]
--no-tags::
	By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded
	from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally.
	This option disables this automatic tag following. The default
	behavior for a remote may be specified with the remote.<name>.tagopt
	setting. See linkgit:git-config[1].

ifndef::git-pull[]
-t::
--tags::
	Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags
	`refs/tags/*` into local tags with the same name), in addition
	to whatever else would otherwise be fetched.  Using this
	option alone does not subject tags to pruning, even if --prune
	is used (though tags may be pruned anyway if they are also the
	destination of an explicit refspec; see '--prune').

--recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]::
	This option controls if and under what conditions new commits of
	populated submodules should be fetched too. It can be used as a
	boolean option to completely disable recursion when set to 'no' or to
	unconditionally recurse into all populated submodules when set to
	'yes', which is the default when this option is used without any
	value. Use 'on-demand' to only recurse into a populated submodule
	when the superproject retrieves a commit that updates the submodule's
	reference to a commit that isn't already in the local submodule
	clone.

--no-recurse-submodules::
	Disable recursive fetching of submodules (this has the same effect as
	using the '--recurse-submodules=no' option).

--submodule-prefix=<path>::
	Prepend <path> to paths printed in informative messages
	such as "Fetching submodule foo".  This option is used
	internally when recursing over submodules.

--recurse-submodules-default=[yes|on-demand]::
	This option is used internally to temporarily provide a
	non-negative default value for the --recurse-submodules
	option.  All other methods of configuring fetch's submodule
	recursion (such as settings in linkgit:gitmodules[5] and
	linkgit:git-config[1]) override this option, as does
	specifying --[no-]recurse-submodules directly.
endif::git-pull[]

-u::
--update-head-ok::
	By default 'git fetch' refuses to update the head which
	corresponds to the current branch.  This flag disables the
	check.  This is purely for the internal use for 'git pull'
	to communicate with 'git fetch', and unless you are
	implementing your own Porcelain you are not supposed to
	use it.

--upload-pack <upload-pack>::
	When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled
	by 'git fetch-pack', '--exec=<upload-pack>' is passed to
	the command to specify non-default path for the command
	run on the other end.

ifndef::git-pull[]
-q::
--quiet::
	Pass --quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence any other internally
	used git commands. Progress is not reported to the standard error
	stream.

-v::
--verbose::
	Be verbose.
endif::git-pull[]

--progress::
	Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
	by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q
	is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the
	standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.


<repository>::
	The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch
	or pull operation.  This parameter can be either a URL
	(see the section <<URLS,GIT URLS>> below) or the name
	of a remote (see the section <<REMOTES,REMOTES>> below).

ifndef::git-pull[]
<group>::
	A name referring to a list of repositories as the value
	of remotes.<group> in the configuration file.
	(See linkgit:git-config[1]).
endif::git-pull[]

<refspec>::
	The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus
	`+`, followed by the source ref <src>, followed
	by a colon `:`, followed by the destination ref <dst>.
+
The remote ref that matches <src>
is fetched, and if <dst> is not empty string, the local
ref that matches it is fast-forwarded using <src>.
If the optional plus `+` is used, the local ref
is updated even if it does not result in a fast-forward
update.
+
[NOTE]
If the remote branch from which you want to pull is
modified in non-linear ways such as being rewound and
rebased frequently, then a pull will attempt a merge with
an older version of itself, likely conflict, and fail.
It is under these conditions that you would want to use
the `+` sign to indicate non-fast-forward updates will
be needed.  There is currently no easy way to determine
or declare that a branch will be made available in a
repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply
must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch.
+
[NOTE]
You never do your own development on branches that appear
on the right hand side of a <refspec> colon on `Pull:` lines;
they are to be updated by 'git fetch'.  If you intend to do
development derived from a remote branch `B`, have a `Pull:`
line to track it (i.e. `Pull: B:remote-B`), and have a separate
branch `my-B` to do your development on top of it.  The latter
is created by `git branch my-B remote-B` (or its equivalent `git
checkout -b my-B remote-B`).  Run `git fetch` to keep track of
the progress of the remote side, and when you see something new
on the remote branch, merge it into your development branch with
`git pull . remote-B`, while you are on `my-B` branch.
+
[NOTE]
There is a difference between listing multiple <refspec>
directly on 'git pull' command line and having multiple
`Pull:` <refspec> lines for a <repository> and running
'git pull' command without any explicit <refspec> parameters.
<refspec> listed explicitly on the command line are always
merged into the current branch after fetching.  In other words,
if you list more than one remote refs, you would be making
an Octopus.  While 'git pull' run without any explicit <refspec>
parameter takes default <refspec>s from `Pull:` lines, it
merges only the first <refspec> found into the current branch,
after fetching all the remote refs.  This is because making an
Octopus from remote refs is rarely done, while keeping track
of multiple remote heads in one-go by fetching more than one
is often useful.
+
Some short-cut notations are also supported.
+
* `tag <tag>` means the same as `refs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>`;
  it requests fetching everything up to the given tag.
ifndef::git-pull[]
* A parameter <ref> without a colon fetches that ref into FETCH_HEAD,
endif::git-pull[]
ifdef::git-pull[]
* A parameter <ref> without a colon merges <ref> into the current
  branch,
endif::git-pull[]
  and updates the remote-tracking branches (if any).


GIT URLS[[URLS]]
----------------

In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository.
Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be
absent.

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp,
and ftps can be used for fetching and rsync can be used for fetching
and pushing, but these are inefficient and deprecated; do not use
them).

The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

The following syntaxes may be used with them:

- ssh://{startsb}user@{endsb}host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- git://host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- http{startsb}s{endsb}://host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- ftp{startsb}s{endsb}://host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/

An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

- {startsb}user@{endsb}host.xz:path/to/repo.git/

This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a
colon. For example the local path `foo:bar` could be specified as an
absolute path or `./foo:bar` to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh
url.

The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username expansion:

- ssh://{startsb}user@{endsb}host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/~{startsb}user{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- git://host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/~{startsb}user{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- {startsb}user@{endsb}host.xz:/~{startsb}user{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/

For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:

- /path/to/repo.git/
- \file:///path/to/repo.git/

ifndef::git-clone[]
These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when
the former implies --local option. See linkgit:git-clone[1] for
details.
endif::git-clone[]

ifdef::git-clone[]
These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except the former implies
--local option.
endif::git-clone[]

When Git doesn't know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the 'remote-<transport>' remote helper, if one
exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax
may be used:

- <transport>::<address>

where <address> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
invoked. See linkgit:gitremote-helpers[1] for details.

If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you
use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a
configuration section of the form:

------------
	[url "<actual url base>"]
		insteadOf = <other url base>
------------

For example, with this:

------------
	[url "git://git.host.xz/"]
		insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
		insteadOf = work:
------------

a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:

------------
	[url "<actual url base>"]
		pushInsteadOf = <other url base>
------------

For example, with this:

------------
	[url "ssh://example.org/"]
		pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
------------

a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to
"ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still
use the original URL.


REMOTES[[REMOTES]]
------------------

The name of one of the following can be used instead
of a URL as `<repository>` argument:

* a remote in the Git configuration file: `$GIT_DIR/config`,
* a file in the `$GIT_DIR/remotes` directory, or
* a file in the `$GIT_DIR/branches` directory.

All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line
because they each contain a refspec which git will use by default.

Named remote in configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously
configured using linkgit:git-remote[1], linkgit:git-config[1]
or even by a manual edit to the `$GIT_DIR/config` file.  The URL of
this remote will be used to access the repository.  The refspec
of this remote will be used by default when you do
not provide a refspec on the command line.  The entry in the
config file would appear like this:

------------
	[remote "<name>"]
		url = <url>
		pushurl = <pushurl>
		push = <refspec>
		fetch = <refspec>
------------

The `<pushurl>` is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults
to `<url>`.

Named file in `$GIT_DIR/remotes`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to provide the name of a
file in `$GIT_DIR/remotes`.  The URL
in this file will be used to access the repository.  The refspec
in this file will be used as default when you do not
provide a refspec on the command line.  This file should have the
following format:

------------
	URL: one of the above URL format
	Push: <refspec>
	Pull: <refspec>

------------

`Push:` lines are used by 'git push' and
`Pull:` lines are used by 'git pull' and 'git fetch'.
Multiple `Push:` and `Pull:` lines may
be specified for additional branch mappings.

Named file in `$GIT_DIR/branches`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to provide the name of a
file in `$GIT_DIR/branches`.
The URL in this file will be used to access the repository.
This file should have the following format:


------------
	<url>#<head>
------------

`<url>` is required; `#<head>` is optional.

Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following
refspecs, if you don't provide one on the command line.
`<branch>` is the name of this file in `$GIT_DIR/branches` and
`<head>` defaults to `master`.

git fetch uses:

------------
	refs/heads/<head>:refs/heads/<branch>
------------

git push uses:

------------
	HEAD:refs/heads/<head>
------------







EXAMPLES
--------

* Update the remote-tracking branches:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ git fetch origin
------------------------------------------------
+
The above command copies all branches from the remote refs/heads/
namespace and stores them to the local refs/remotes/origin/ namespace,
unless the branch.<name>.fetch option is used to specify a non-default
refspec.

* Using refspecs explicitly:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ git fetch origin +pu:pu maint:tmp
------------------------------------------------
+
This updates (or creates, as necessary) branches `pu` and `tmp` in
the local repository by fetching from the branches (respectively)
`pu` and `maint` from the remote repository.
+
The `pu` branch will be updated even if it is does not fast-forward,
because it is prefixed with a plus sign; `tmp` will not be.


BUGS
----
Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in already checked
out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new submodule in the
just fetched commits of the superproject the submodule itself can not be
fetched, making it impossible to check out that submodule later without
having to do a fetch again. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git
version.
