NAME
----
git-pull - Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git pull' [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>...]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current
branch.  In its default mode, `git pull` is shorthand for
`git fetch` followed by `git merge FETCH_HEAD`.

More precisely, 'git pull' runs 'git fetch' with the given
parameters and calls 'git merge' to merge the retrieved branch
heads into the current branch.
With `--rebase`, it runs 'git rebase' instead of 'git merge'.

<repository> should be the name of a remote repository as
passed to linkgit:git-fetch[1].  <refspec> can name an
arbitrary remote ref (for example, the name of a tag) or even
a collection of refs with corresponding remote-tracking branches
(e.g., refs/heads/{asterisk}:refs/remotes/origin/{asterisk}),
but usually it is the name of a branch in the remote repository.

Default values for <repository> and <branch> are read from the
"remote" and "merge" configuration for the current branch
as set by linkgit:git-branch[1] `--track`.

Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
"`master`":

------------
	  A---B---C master on origin
	 /
    D---E---F---G master
	^
	origin/master in your repository
------------

Then "`git pull`" will fetch and replay the changes from the remote
`master` branch since it diverged from the local `master` (i.e., `E`)
until its current commit (`C`) on top of `master` and record the
result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits
and a log message from the user describing the changes.

------------
	  A---B---C origin/master
	 /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master
------------

See linkgit:git-merge[1] for details, including how conflicts
are presented and handled.

In Git 1.7.0 or later, to cancel a conflicting merge, use
`git reset --merge`.  *Warning*: In older versions of Git, running 'git pull'
with uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves you
in a state that may be hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

If any of the remote changes overlap with local uncommitted changes,
the merge will be automatically canceled and the work tree untouched.
It is generally best to get any local changes in working order before
pulling or stash them away with linkgit:git-stash[1].

OPTIONS
-------

-q::
--quiet::
	This is passed to both underlying git-fetch to squelch reporting of
	during transfer, and underlying git-merge to squelch output during
	merging.

-v::
--verbose::
	Pass --verbose to git-fetch and git-merge.

--[no-]recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]::
	This option controls if new commits of all populated submodules should
	be fetched and updated, too (see linkgit:git-config[1] and
	linkgit:gitmodules[5]).
+
If the checkout is done via rebase, local submodule commits are rebased as well.
+
If the update is done via merge, the submodule conflicts are resolved and checked out.

Options related to merging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:git-pull: 1

--commit::
--no-commit::
	Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can
	be used to override --no-commit.
+
With --no-commit perform the merge but pretend the merge
failed and do not autocommit, to give the user a chance to
inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing.

--edit::
-e::
--no-edit::
	Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to
	further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user
	can explain and justify the merge. The `--no-edit` option can be
	used to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally
	discouraged).
ifndef::git-pull[]
The `--edit` (or `-e`) option is still useful if you are
giving a draft message with the `-m` option from the command line
and want to edit it in the editor.
endif::git-pull[]
+
Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the
user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor opened when
they run `git merge`. To make it easier to adjust such scripts to the
updated behaviour, the environment variable `GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT` can be
set to `no` at the beginning of them.

--ff::
	When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the branch
	pointer, without creating a merge commit.  This is the default
	behavior.

--no-ff::
	Create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a
	fast-forward.  This is the default behaviour when merging an
	annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not stored in
	its natural place in 'refs/tags/' hierarchy.

--ff-only::
	Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the
	current `HEAD` is already up to date or the merge can be
	resolved as a fast-forward.

-S[<keyid>]::
--gpg-sign[=<keyid>]::
	GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The `keyid` argument is
	optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified,
	it must be stuck to the option without a space.

--log[=<n>]::
--no-log::
	In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
	one-line descriptions from at most <n> actual commits that are being
	merged. See also linkgit:git-fmt-merge-msg[1].
+
With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the
actual commits being merged.

--signoff::
--no-signoff::
	Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit
	log message.  The meaning of a signoff depends on the project,
	but it typically certifies that committer has
	the rights to submit this work under the same license and
	agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin
	(see http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).
+
With --no-signoff do not add a Signed-off-by line.

--stat::
-n::
--no-stat::
	Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also
	controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.
+
With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the
merge.

--squash::
--no-squash::
	Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge
	happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually
	make a commit, move the `HEAD`, or record `$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD`
	(to cause the next `git commit` command to create a merge
	commit).  This allows you to create a single commit on top of
	the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another
	branch (or more in case of an octopus).
+
With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This
option can be used to override --squash.

-s <strategy>::
--strategy=<strategy>::
	Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than
	once to specify them in the order they should be tried.
	If there is no `-s` option, a built-in list of strategies
	is used instead ('git merge-recursive' when merging a single
	head, 'git merge-octopus' otherwise).

-X <option>::
--strategy-option=<option>::
	Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
	strategy.

--verify-signatures::
--no-verify-signatures::
	Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is
	signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the
	default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by
	a trusted key.  If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed
	with a valid key, the merge is aborted.

--summary::
--no-summary::
	Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and will be
	removed in the future.

ifndef::git-pull[]
-q::
--quiet::
	Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.

-v::
--verbose::
	Be verbose.

--progress::
--no-progress::
	Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
	progress is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal.
	Note that not all merge strategies may support progress
	reporting.

endif::git-pull[]

--allow-unrelated-histories::
	By default, `git merge` command refuses to merge histories
	that do not share a common ancestor.  This option can be
	used to override this safety when merging histories of two
	projects that started their lives independently. As that is
	a very rare occasion, no configuration variable to enable
	this by default exists and will not be added.


-r::
--rebase[=false|true|merges|preserve|interactive]::
	When true, rebase the current branch on top of the upstream
	branch after fetching. If there is a remote-tracking branch
	corresponding to the upstream branch and the upstream branch
	was rebased since last fetched, the rebase uses that information
	to avoid rebasing non-local changes.
+
When set to `merges`, rebase using `git rebase --rebase-merges` so that
the local merge commits are included in the rebase (see
linkgit:git-rebase[1] for details).
+
When set to preserve, rebase with the `--preserve-merges` option passed
to `git rebase` so that locally created merge commits will not be flattened.
+
When false, merge the current branch into the upstream branch.
+
When `interactive`, enable the interactive mode of rebase.
+
See `pull.rebase`, `branch.<name>.rebase` and `branch.autoSetupRebase` in
linkgit:git-config[1] if you want to make `git pull` always use
`--rebase` instead of merging.
+
[NOTE]
This is a potentially _dangerous_ mode of operation.
It rewrites history, which does not bode well when you
published that history already.  Do *not* use this option
unless you have read linkgit:git-rebase[1] carefully.

--no-rebase::
	Override earlier --rebase.

--autostash::
--no-autostash::
	Before starting rebase, stash local modifications away (see
	linkgit:git-stash[1]) if needed, and apply the stash entry when
	done. `--no-autostash` is useful to override the `rebase.autoStash`
	configuration variable (see linkgit:git-config[1]).
+
This option is only valid when "--rebase" is used.

Options related to fetching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--all::
	Fetch all remotes.

-a::
--append::
	Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the
	existing contents of `.git/FETCH_HEAD`.  Without this
	option old data in `.git/FETCH_HEAD` will be overwritten.

--depth=<depth>::
	Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of
	each remote branch history. If fetching to a 'shallow' repository
	created by `git clone` with `--depth=<depth>` option (see
	linkgit:git-clone[1]), deepen or shorten the history to the specified
	number of commits. Tags for the deepened commits are not fetched.

--deepen=<depth>::
	Similar to --depth, except it specifies the number of commits
	from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of
	each remote branch history.

--shallow-since=<date>::
	Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to
	include all reachable commits after <date>.

--shallow-exclude=<revision>::
	Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to
	exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag.
	This option can be specified multiple times.

--unshallow::
	If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow
	repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations
	imposed by shallow repositories.
+
If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that
the current repository has the same history as the source repository.

--update-shallow::
	By default when fetching from a shallow repository,
	`git fetch` refuses refs that require updating
	.git/shallow. This option updates .git/shallow and accept such
	refs.

ifndef::git-pull[]
--dry-run::
	Show what would be done, without making any changes.
endif::git-pull[]

-f::
--force::
	When 'git fetch' is used with `<rbranch>:<lbranch>`
	refspec, it refuses to update the local branch
	`<lbranch>` unless the remote branch `<rbranch>` it
	fetches is a descendant of `<lbranch>`.  This option
	overrides that check.

-k::
--keep::
	Keep downloaded pack.

ifndef::git-pull[]
--multiple::
	Allow several <repository> and <group> arguments to be
	specified. No <refspec>s may be specified.

-p::
--prune::
	Before fetching, remove any remote-tracking references that no
	longer exist on the remote.  Tags are not subject to pruning
	if they are fetched only because of the default tag
	auto-following or due to a --tags option.  However, if tags
	are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the command
	line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote
	was cloned with the --mirror option), then they are also
	subject to pruning. Supplying `--prune-tags` is a shorthand for
	providing the tag refspec.
+
See the PRUNING section below for more details.

-P::
--prune-tags::
	Before fetching, remove any local tags that no longer exist on
	the remote if `--prune` is enabled. This option should be used
	more carefully, unlike `--prune` it will remove any local
	references (local tags) that have been created. This option is
	a shorthand for providing the explicit tag refspec along with
	`--prune`, see the discussion about that in its documentation.
+
See the PRUNING section below for more details.

endif::git-pull[]

ifndef::git-pull[]
-n::
endif::git-pull[]
--no-tags::
	By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded
	from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally.
	This option disables this automatic tag following. The default
	behavior for a remote may be specified with the remote.<name>.tagOpt
	setting. See linkgit:git-config[1].

ifndef::git-pull[]
--refmap=<refspec>::
	When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the
	specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the
	refs to remote-tracking branches, instead of the values of
	`remote.*.fetch` configuration variables for the remote
	repository.  See section on "Configured Remote-tracking
	Branches" for details.

-t::
--tags::
	Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags
	`refs/tags/*` into local tags with the same name), in addition
	to whatever else would otherwise be fetched.  Using this
	option alone does not subject tags to pruning, even if --prune
	is used (though tags may be pruned anyway if they are also the
	destination of an explicit refspec; see `--prune`).

--recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]::
	This option controls if and under what conditions new commits of
	populated submodules should be fetched too. It can be used as a
	boolean option to completely disable recursion when set to 'no' or to
	unconditionally recurse into all populated submodules when set to
	'yes', which is the default when this option is used without any
	value. Use 'on-demand' to only recurse into a populated submodule
	when the superproject retrieves a commit that updates the submodule's
	reference to a commit that isn't already in the local submodule
	clone.

-j::
--jobs=<n>::
	Number of parallel children to be used for fetching submodules.
	Each will fetch from different submodules, such that fetching many
	submodules will be faster. By default submodules will be fetched
	one at a time.

--no-recurse-submodules::
	Disable recursive fetching of submodules (this has the same effect as
	using the `--recurse-submodules=no` option).

--submodule-prefix=<path>::
	Prepend <path> to paths printed in informative messages
	such as "Fetching submodule foo".  This option is used
	internally when recursing over submodules.

--recurse-submodules-default=[yes|on-demand]::
	This option is used internally to temporarily provide a
	non-negative default value for the --recurse-submodules
	option.  All other methods of configuring fetch's submodule
	recursion (such as settings in linkgit:gitmodules[5] and
	linkgit:git-config[1]) override this option, as does
	specifying --[no-]recurse-submodules directly.
endif::git-pull[]

-u::
--update-head-ok::
	By default 'git fetch' refuses to update the head which
	corresponds to the current branch.  This flag disables the
	check.  This is purely for the internal use for 'git pull'
	to communicate with 'git fetch', and unless you are
	implementing your own Porcelain you are not supposed to
	use it.

--upload-pack <upload-pack>::
	When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled
	by 'git fetch-pack', `--exec=<upload-pack>` is passed to
	the command to specify non-default path for the command
	run on the other end.

ifndef::git-pull[]
-q::
--quiet::
	Pass --quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence any other internally
	used git commands. Progress is not reported to the standard error
	stream.

-v::
--verbose::
	Be verbose.
endif::git-pull[]

--progress::
	Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
	by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q
	is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the
	standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

-o <option>::
--server-option=<option>::
	Transmit the given string to the server when communicating using
	protocol version 2.  The given string must not contain a NUL or LF
	character.
	When multiple `--server-option=<option>` are given, they are all
	sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line.

-4::
--ipv4::
	Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.

-6::
--ipv6::
	Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.


<repository>::
	The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch
	or pull operation.  This parameter can be either a URL
	(see the section <<URLS,GIT URLS>> below) or the name
	of a remote (see the section <<REMOTES,REMOTES>> below).

ifndef::git-pull[]
<group>::
	A name referring to a list of repositories as the value
	of remotes.<group> in the configuration file.
	(See linkgit:git-config[1]).
endif::git-pull[]

<refspec>::
	Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update.
	When no <refspec>s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch
	are read from `remote.<repository>.fetch` variables instead
ifndef::git-pull[]
	(see <<CRTB,CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES>> below).
endif::git-pull[]
ifdef::git-pull[]
	(see linkgit:git-fetch[1]).
endif::git-pull[]
+
The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus
`+`, followed by the source <src>, followed
by a colon `:`, followed by the destination ref <dst>.
The colon can be omitted when <dst> is empty.  <src> is
typically a ref, but it can also be a fully spelled hex object
name.
+
`tag <tag>` means the same as `refs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>`;
it requests fetching everything up to the given tag.
+
The remote ref that matches <src>
is fetched, and if <dst> is not empty string, the local
ref that matches it is fast-forwarded using <src>.
If the optional plus `+` is used, the local ref
is updated even if it does not result in a fast-forward
update.
+
[NOTE]
When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to
be rewound and rebased regularly, it is expected that
its new tip will not be descendant of its previous tip
(as stored in your remote-tracking branch the last time
you fetched).  You would want
to use the `+` sign to indicate non-fast-forward updates
will be needed for such branches.  There is no way to
determine or declare that a branch will be made available
in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply
must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch.
ifdef::git-pull[]
+
[NOTE]
There is a difference between listing multiple <refspec>
directly on 'git pull' command line and having multiple
`remote.<repository>.fetch` entries in your configuration
for a <repository> and running a
'git pull' command without any explicit <refspec> parameters.
<refspec>s listed explicitly on the command line are always
merged into the current branch after fetching.  In other words,
if you list more than one remote ref, 'git pull' will create
an Octopus merge.  On the other hand, if you do not list any
explicit <refspec> parameter on the command line, 'git pull'
will fetch all the <refspec>s it finds in the
`remote.<repository>.fetch` configuration and merge
only the first <refspec> found into the current branch.
This is because making an
Octopus from remote refs is rarely done, while keeping track
of multiple remote heads in one-go by fetching more than one
is often useful.
endif::git-pull[]


GIT URLS[[URLS]]
----------------

In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository.
Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be
absent.

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp,
and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and
deprecated; do not use it).

The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

The following syntaxes may be used with them:

- ssh://{startsb}user@{endsb}host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- git://host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- http{startsb}s{endsb}://host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- ftp{startsb}s{endsb}://host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/

An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

- {startsb}user@{endsb}host.xz:path/to/repo.git/

This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a
colon. For example the local path `foo:bar` could be specified as an
absolute path or `./foo:bar` to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh
url.

The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username expansion:

- ssh://{startsb}user@{endsb}host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/~{startsb}user{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- git://host.xz{startsb}:port{endsb}/~{startsb}user{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/
- {startsb}user@{endsb}host.xz:/~{startsb}user{endsb}/path/to/repo.git/

For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:

- /path/to/repo.git/
- \file:///path/to/repo.git/

ifndef::git-clone[]
These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when
the former implies --local option. See linkgit:git-clone[1] for
details.
endif::git-clone[]

ifdef::git-clone[]
These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except the former implies
--local option.
endif::git-clone[]

When Git doesn't know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the 'remote-<transport>' remote helper, if one
exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax
may be used:

- <transport>::<address>

where <address> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
invoked. See linkgit:gitremote-helpers[1] for details.

If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you
use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a
configuration section of the form:

------------
	[url "<actual url base>"]
		insteadOf = <other url base>
------------

For example, with this:

------------
	[url "git://git.host.xz/"]
		insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
		insteadOf = work:
------------

a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:

------------
	[url "<actual url base>"]
		pushInsteadOf = <other url base>
------------

For example, with this:

------------
	[url "ssh://example.org/"]
		pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
------------

a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to
"ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still
use the original URL.


REMOTES[[REMOTES]]
------------------

The name of one of the following can be used instead
of a URL as `<repository>` argument:

* a remote in the Git configuration file: `$GIT_DIR/config`,
* a file in the `$GIT_DIR/remotes` directory, or
* a file in the `$GIT_DIR/branches` directory.

All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line
because they each contain a refspec which git will use by default.

Named remote in configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously
configured using linkgit:git-remote[1], linkgit:git-config[1]
or even by a manual edit to the `$GIT_DIR/config` file.  The URL of
this remote will be used to access the repository.  The refspec
of this remote will be used by default when you do
not provide a refspec on the command line.  The entry in the
config file would appear like this:

------------
	[remote "<name>"]
		url = <url>
		pushurl = <pushurl>
		push = <refspec>
		fetch = <refspec>
------------

The `<pushurl>` is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults
to `<url>`.

Named file in `$GIT_DIR/remotes`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to provide the name of a
file in `$GIT_DIR/remotes`.  The URL
in this file will be used to access the repository.  The refspec
in this file will be used as default when you do not
provide a refspec on the command line.  This file should have the
following format:

------------
	URL: one of the above URL format
	Push: <refspec>
	Pull: <refspec>

------------

`Push:` lines are used by 'git push' and
`Pull:` lines are used by 'git pull' and 'git fetch'.
Multiple `Push:` and `Pull:` lines may
be specified for additional branch mappings.

Named file in `$GIT_DIR/branches`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to provide the name of a
file in `$GIT_DIR/branches`.
The URL in this file will be used to access the repository.
This file should have the following format:


------------
	<url>#<head>
------------

`<url>` is required; `#<head>` is optional.

Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following
refspecs, if you don't provide one on the command line.
`<branch>` is the name of this file in `$GIT_DIR/branches` and
`<head>` defaults to `master`.

git fetch uses:

------------
	refs/heads/<head>:refs/heads/<branch>
------------

git push uses:

------------
	HEAD:refs/heads/<head>
------------






MERGE STRATEGIES
----------------

The merge mechanism (`git merge` and `git pull` commands) allows the
backend 'merge strategies' to be chosen with `-s` option.  Some strategies
can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving `-X<option>`
arguments to `git merge` and/or `git pull`.

resolve::
	This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch
	and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge
	algorithm.  It tries to carefully detect criss-cross
	merge ambiguities and is considered generally safe and
	fast.

recursive::
	This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
	algorithm.  When there is more than one common
	ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a
	merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
	the reference tree for the 3-way merge.  This has been
	reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without
	causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits
	taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
	Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving
	renames, but currently cannot make use of detected
	copies.  This is the default merge strategy when pulling
	or merging one branch.
+
The 'recursive' strategy can take the following options:

ours;;
	This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by
	favoring 'our' version.  Changes from the other tree that do not
	conflict with our side are reflected to the merge result.
	For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from our side.
+
This should not be confused with the 'ours' merge strategy, which does not
even look at what the other tree contains at all.  It discards everything
the other tree did, declaring 'our' history contains all that happened in it.

theirs;;
	This is the opposite of 'ours'; note that, unlike 'ours', there is
	no 'theirs' merge strategy to confuse this merge option with.

patience;;
	With this option, 'merge-recursive' spends a little extra time
	to avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant
	matching lines (e.g., braces from distinct functions).  Use
	this when the branches to be merged have diverged wildly.
	See also linkgit:git-diff[1] `--patience`.

diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers];;
	Tells 'merge-recursive' to use a different diff algorithm, which
	can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching
	lines (such as braces from distinct functions).  See also
	linkgit:git-diff[1] `--diff-algorithm`.

ignore-space-change;;
ignore-all-space;;
ignore-space-at-eol;;
ignore-cr-at-eol;;
	Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as
	unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge.  Whitespace
	changes mixed with other changes to a line are not ignored.
	See also linkgit:git-diff[1] `-b`, `-w`,
	`--ignore-space-at-eol`, and `--ignore-cr-at-eol`.
+
* If 'their' version only introduces whitespace changes to a line,
  'our' version is used;
* If 'our' version introduces whitespace changes but 'their'
  version includes a substantial change, 'their' version is used;
* Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.

renormalize;;
	This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages
	of a file when resolving a three-way merge.  This option is
	meant to be used when merging branches with different clean
	filters or end-of-line normalization rules.  See "Merging
	branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes" in
	linkgit:gitattributes[5] for details.

no-renormalize;;
	Disables the `renormalize` option.  This overrides the
	`merge.renormalize` configuration variable.

no-renames;;
	Turn off rename detection. This overrides the `merge.renames`
	configuration variable.
	See also linkgit:git-diff[1] `--no-renames`.

find-renames[=<n>];;
	Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity
	threshold.  This is the default. This overrides the
	'merge.renames' configuration variable.
	See also linkgit:git-diff[1] `--find-renames`.

rename-threshold=<n>;;
	Deprecated synonym for `find-renames=<n>`.

subtree[=<path>];;
	This option is a more advanced form of 'subtree' strategy, where
	the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to
	match with each other when merging.  Instead, the specified path
	is prefixed (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of
	two trees to match.

octopus::
	This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do
	a complex merge that needs manual resolution.  It is
	primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch
	heads together.  This is the default merge strategy when
	pulling or merging more than one branch.

ours::
	This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the
	merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively
	ignoring all changes from all other branches.  It is meant to
	be used to supersede old development history of side
	branches.  Note that this is different from the -Xours option to
	the 'recursive' merge strategy.

subtree::
	This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and
	B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to
	match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at
	the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common
	ancestor tree.

With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, 'recursive'),
if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the
branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people find
this behavior confusing.  It occurs because only the heads and the merge base
are considered when performing a merge, not the individual commits.  The merge
algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as no change at all, and
substitutes the changed version instead.


DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR
-----------------

Often people use `git pull` without giving any parameter.
Traditionally, this has been equivalent to saying `git pull
origin`.  However, when configuration `branch.<name>.remote` is
present while on branch `<name>`, that value is used instead of
`origin`.

In order to determine what URL to use to fetch from, the value
of the configuration `remote.<origin>.url` is consulted
and if there is not any such variable, the value on the `URL:` line
in `$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>` is used.

In order to determine what remote branches to fetch (and
optionally store in the remote-tracking branches) when the command is
run without any refspec parameters on the command line, values
of the configuration variable `remote.<origin>.fetch` are
consulted, and if there aren't any, `$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>`
is consulted and its `Pull:` lines are used.
In addition to the refspec formats described in the OPTIONS
section, you can have a globbing refspec that looks like this:

------------
refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
------------

A globbing refspec must have a non-empty RHS (i.e. must store
what were fetched in remote-tracking branches), and its LHS and RHS
must end with `/*`.  The above specifies that all remote
branches are tracked using remote-tracking branches in
`refs/remotes/origin/` hierarchy under the same name.

The rule to determine which remote branch to merge after
fetching is a bit involved, in order not to break backward
compatibility.

If explicit refspecs were given on the command
line of `git pull`, they are all merged.

When no refspec was given on the command line, then `git pull`
uses the refspec from the configuration or
`$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>`.  In such cases, the following
rules apply:

. If `branch.<name>.merge` configuration for the current
  branch `<name>` exists, that is the name of the branch at the
  remote site that is merged.

. If the refspec is a globbing one, nothing is merged.

. Otherwise the remote branch of the first refspec is merged.


EXAMPLES
--------

* Update the remote-tracking branches for the repository
  you cloned from, then merge one of them into your
  current branch:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ git pull
$ git pull origin
------------------------------------------------
+
Normally the branch merged in is the HEAD of the remote repository,
but the choice is determined by the branch.<name>.remote and
branch.<name>.merge options; see linkgit:git-config[1] for details.

* Merge into the current branch the remote branch `next`:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ git pull origin next
------------------------------------------------
+
This leaves a copy of `next` temporarily in FETCH_HEAD, but
does not update any remote-tracking branches. Using remote-tracking
branches, the same can be done by invoking fetch and merge:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/next
------------------------------------------------


If you tried a pull which resulted in complex conflicts and
would want to start over, you can recover with 'git reset'.


SECURITY
--------
The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from
stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious
peer, your best option is to store it in another repository. This applies
to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a server are not
effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a
namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire
repository.

The known attack vectors are as follows:

. The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that
  are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to optimize the
  transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object ID X
  to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn't required to send the content of
  X because the victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the
  attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker
  later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a
  server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has access
  to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it
  on a client is to "merge" X into a public branch and hope that the user
  does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
  without noticing the merge.)

. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends
  an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker falsely
  claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X.
  The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.


BUGS
----
Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in already checked
out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new submodule in the
just fetched commits of the superproject the submodule itself can not be
fetched, making it impossible to check out that submodule later without
having to do a fetch again. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git
version.
