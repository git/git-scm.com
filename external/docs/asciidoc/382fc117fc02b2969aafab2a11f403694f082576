NAME
----
git-show - Show various types of objects


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git show' [<options>] [<object>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).

For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also
presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by
'git diff-tree --cc'.

For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.

For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to 'git ls-tree'
with --name-only).

For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.

The command takes options applicable to the 'git diff-tree' command to
control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.


OPTIONS
-------
<object>...::
	The names of objects to show (defaults to 'HEAD').
	For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see
	"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in linkgit:gitrevisions[7].

--pretty[=<format>]::
--format=<format>::

	Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format,
	where '<format>' can be one of 'oneline', 'short', 'medium',
	'full', 'fuller', 'reference', 'email', 'raw', 'format:<string>'
	and 'tformat:<string>'.  When '<format>' is none of the above,
	and has '%placeholder' in it, it acts as if
	'--pretty=tformat:<format>' were given.
+
See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details for each
format.  When '=<format>' part is omitted, it defaults to 'medium'.
+
Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
configuration (see linkgit:git-config[1]).

--abbrev-commit::
	Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object
	name, show only a partial prefix.  Non default number of
	digits can be specified with "--abbrev=<n>" (which also modifies
	diff output, if it is displayed).
+
This should make "--pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for
people using 80-column terminals.

--no-abbrev-commit::
	Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This negates
	`--abbrev-commit` and those options which imply it such as
	"--oneline". It also overrides the `log.abbrevCommit` variable.

--oneline::
	This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit"
	used together.

--encoding=<encoding>::
	The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message
	in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the
	command to re-code the commit log message in the encoding
	preferred by the user.  For non plumbing commands this
	defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object claims to be encoded
	in `X` and we are outputting in `X`, we will output the object
	verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original
	commit may be copied to the output.

--expand-tabs=<n>::
--expand-tabs::
--no-expand-tabs::
	Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough spaces
	to fill to the next display column that is multiple of '<n>')
	in the log message before showing it in the output.
	`--expand-tabs` is a short-hand for `--expand-tabs=8`, and
	`--no-expand-tabs` is a short-hand for `--expand-tabs=0`,
	which disables tab expansion.
+
By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the log
message by 4 spaces (i.e.  'medium', which is the default, 'full',
and 'fuller').

ifndef::git-rev-list[]
--notes[=<ref>]::
	Show the notes (see linkgit:git-notes[1]) that annotate the
	commit, when showing the commit log message.  This is the default
	for `git log`, `git show` and `git whatchanged` commands when
	there is no `--pretty`, `--format`, or `--oneline` option given
	on the command line.
+
By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
`core.notesRef` and `notes.displayRef` variables (or corresponding
environment overrides). See linkgit:git-config[1] for more details.
+
With an optional '<ref>' argument, use the ref to find the notes
to display.  The ref can specify the full refname when it begins
with `refs/notes/`; when it begins with `notes/`, `refs/` and otherwise
`refs/notes/` is prefixed to form a full name of the ref.
+
Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes are
being displayed. Examples: "--notes=foo" will show only notes from
"refs/notes/foo"; "--notes=foo --notes" will show both notes from
"refs/notes/foo" and from the default notes ref(s).

--no-notes::
	Do not show notes. This negates the above `--notes` option, by
	resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown.
	Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g.
	"--notes --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar" will only show notes
	from "refs/notes/bar".

--show-notes[=<ref>]::
--[no-]standard-notes::
	These options are deprecated. Use the above --notes/--no-notes
	options instead.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--show-signature::
	Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the signature
	to `gpg --verify` and show the output.



PRETTY FORMATS
--------------

If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format
is not 'oneline', 'email' or 'raw', an additional line is
inserted before the 'Author:' line.  This line begins with
"Merge: " and the hashes of ancestral commits are printed,
separated by spaces.  Note that the listed commits may not
necessarily be the list of the *direct* parent commits if you
have limited your view of history: for example, if you are
only interested in changes related to a certain directory or
file.

There are several built-in formats, and you can define
additional formats by setting a pretty.<name>
config option to either another format name, or a
'format:' string, as described below (see
linkgit:git-config[1]). Here are the details of the
built-in formats:

* 'oneline'

	  <hash> <title line>
+
This is designed to be as compact as possible.

* 'short'

	  commit <hash>
	  Author: <author>

	      <title line>

* 'medium'

	  commit <hash>
	  Author: <author>
	  Date:   <author date>

	      <title line>

	      <full commit message>

* 'full'

	  commit <hash>
	  Author: <author>
	  Commit: <committer>

	      <title line>

	      <full commit message>

* 'fuller'

	  commit <hash>
	  Author:     <author>
	  AuthorDate: <author date>
	  Commit:     <committer>
	  CommitDate: <committer date>

	       <title line>

	       <full commit message>

* 'reference'

	  <abbrev hash> (<title line>, <short author date>)
+
This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message and
is the same as `--pretty='format:%C(auto)%h (%s, %ad)'`.  By default,
the date is formatted with `--date=short` unless another `--date` option
is explicitly specified.  As with any `format:` with format
placeholders, its output is not affected by other options like
`--decorate` and `--walk-reflogs`.

* 'email'

	  From <hash> <date>
	  From: <author>
	  Date: <author date>
	  Subject: [PATCH] <title line>

	  <full commit message>

* 'mboxrd'
+
Like 'email', but lines in the commit message starting with "From "
(preceded by zero or more ">") are quoted with ">" so they aren't
confused as starting a new commit.

* 'raw'
+
The 'raw' format shows the entire commit exactly as
stored in the commit object.  Notably, the hashes are
displayed in full, regardless of whether --abbrev or
--no-abbrev are used, and 'parents' information show the
true parent commits, without taking grafts or history
simplification into account. Note that this format affects the way
commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e.g. with
`git log --raw`. To get full object names in a raw diff format,
use `--no-abbrev`.

* 'format:<string>'
+
The 'format:<string>' format allows you to specify which information
you want to show. It works a little bit like printf format,
with the notable exception that you get a newline with '%n'
instead of '\n'.
+
E.g, 'format:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"'
would show something like this:
+
-------
The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was >>t4119: test autocomputing -p<n> for traditional diff input.<<

-------
+
The placeholders are:

- Placeholders that expand to a single literal character:
'%n':: newline
'%%':: a raw '%'
'%x00':: print a byte from a hex code

- Placeholders that affect formatting of later placeholders:
'%Cred':: switch color to red
'%Cgreen':: switch color to green
'%Cblue':: switch color to blue
'%Creset':: reset color
'%C(...)':: color specification, as described under Values in the
	    "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of linkgit:git-config[1].  By
	    default, colors are shown only when enabled for log output
	    (by `color.diff`, `color.ui`, or `--color`, and respecting
	    the `auto` settings of the former if we are going to a
	    terminal). `%C(auto,...)` is accepted as a historical
	    synonym for the default (e.g., `%C(auto,red)`). Specifying
	    `%C(always,...)` will show the colors even when color is
	    not otherwise enabled (though consider just using
	    `--color=always` to enable color for the whole output,
	    including this format and anything else git might color).
	    `auto` alone (i.e. `%C(auto)`) will turn on auto coloring
	    on the next placeholders until the color is switched
	    again.
'%m':: left (`<`), right (`>`) or boundary (`-`) mark
'%w([<w>[,<i1>[,<i2>]]])':: switch line wrapping, like the -w option of
			    linkgit:git-shortlog[1].
'%<(<N>[,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc])':: make the next placeholder take at
				  least N columns, padding spaces on
				  the right if necessary.  Optionally
				  truncate at the beginning (ltrunc),
				  the middle (mtrunc) or the end
				  (trunc) if the output is longer than
				  N columns.  Note that truncating
				  only works correctly with N >= 2.
'%<|(<N>)':: make the next placeholder take at least until Nth
	     columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary
'%>(<N>)', '%>|(<N>)':: similar to '%<(<N>)', '%<|(<N>)' respectively,
			but padding spaces on the left
'%>>(<N>)', '%>>|(<N>)':: similar to '%>(<N>)', '%>|(<N>)'
			  respectively, except that if the next
			  placeholder takes more spaces than given and
			  there are spaces on its left, use those
			  spaces
'%><(<N>)', '%><|(<N>)':: similar to '%<(<N>)', '%<|(<N>)'
			  respectively, but padding both sides
			  (i.e. the text is centered)

- Placeholders that expand to information extracted from the commit:
'%H':: commit hash
'%h':: abbreviated commit hash
'%T':: tree hash
'%t':: abbreviated tree hash
'%P':: parent hashes
'%p':: abbreviated parent hashes
'%an':: author name
'%aN':: author name (respecting .mailmap, see linkgit:git-shortlog[1]
	or linkgit:git-blame[1])
'%ae':: author email
'%aE':: author email (respecting .mailmap, see linkgit:git-shortlog[1]
	or linkgit:git-blame[1])
'%al':: author email local-part (the part before the '@' sign)
'%aL':: author local-part (see '%al') respecting .mailmap, see
	linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
'%ad':: author date (format respects --date= option)
'%aD':: author date, RFC2822 style
'%ar':: author date, relative
'%at':: author date, UNIX timestamp
'%ai':: author date, ISO 8601-like format
'%aI':: author date, strict ISO 8601 format
'%as':: author date, short format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
'%cn':: committer name
'%cN':: committer name (respecting .mailmap, see
	linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
'%ce':: committer email
'%cE':: committer email (respecting .mailmap, see
	linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
'%cl':: committer email local-part (the part before the '@' sign)
'%cL':: committer local-part (see '%cl') respecting .mailmap, see
	linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
'%cd':: committer date (format respects --date= option)
'%cD':: committer date, RFC2822 style
'%cr':: committer date, relative
'%ct':: committer date, UNIX timestamp
'%ci':: committer date, ISO 8601-like format
'%cI':: committer date, strict ISO 8601 format
'%cs':: committer date, short format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
'%d':: ref names, like the --decorate option of linkgit:git-log[1]
'%D':: ref names without the " (", ")" wrapping.
'%S':: ref name given on the command line by which the commit was reached
       (like `git log --source`), only works with `git log`
'%e':: encoding
'%s':: subject
'%f':: sanitized subject line, suitable for a filename
'%b':: body
'%B':: raw body (unwrapped subject and body)
ifndef::git-rev-list[]
'%N':: commit notes
endif::git-rev-list[]
'%GG':: raw verification message from GPG for a signed commit
'%G?':: show "G" for a good (valid) signature,
	"B" for a bad signature,
	"U" for a good signature with unknown validity,
	"X" for a good signature that has expired,
	"Y" for a good signature made by an expired key,
	"R" for a good signature made by a revoked key,
	"E" if the signature cannot be checked (e.g. missing key)
	and "N" for no signature
'%GS':: show the name of the signer for a signed commit
'%GK':: show the key used to sign a signed commit
'%GF':: show the fingerprint of the key used to sign a signed commit
'%GP':: show the fingerprint of the primary key whose subkey was used
	to sign a signed commit
'%GT':: show the trust level for the key used to sign a signed commit
'%gD':: reflog selector, e.g., `refs/stash@{1}` or `refs/stash@{2
	minutes ago}`; the format follows the rules described for the
	`-g` option. The portion before the `@` is the refname as
	given on the command line (so `git log -g refs/heads/master`
	would yield `refs/heads/master@{0}`).
'%gd':: shortened reflog selector; same as `%gD`, but the refname
	portion is shortened for human readability (so
	`refs/heads/master` becomes just `master`).
'%gn':: reflog identity name
'%gN':: reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see
	linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
'%ge':: reflog identity email
'%gE':: reflog identity email (respecting .mailmap, see
	linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
'%gs':: reflog subject
'%(trailers[:options])':: display the trailers of the body as
			  interpreted by
			  linkgit:git-interpret-trailers[1]. The
			  `trailers` string may be followed by a colon
			  and zero or more comma-separated options:
** 'key=<K>': only show trailers with specified key. Matching is done
   case-insensitively and trailing colon is optional. If option is
   given multiple times trailer lines matching any of the keys are
   shown. This option automatically enables the `only` option so that
   non-trailer lines in the trailer block are hidden. If that is not
   desired it can be disabled with `only=false`.  E.g.,
   `%(trailers:key=Reviewed-by)` shows trailer lines with key
   `Reviewed-by`.
** 'only[=val]': select whether non-trailer lines from the trailer
   block should be included. The `only` keyword may optionally be
   followed by an equal sign and one of `true`, `on`, `yes` to omit or
   `false`, `off`, `no` to show the non-trailer lines. If option is
   given without value it is enabled. If given multiple times the last
   value is used.
** 'separator=<SEP>': specify a separator inserted between trailer
   lines. When this option is not given each trailer line is
   terminated with a line feed character. The string SEP may contain
   the literal formatting codes described above. To use comma as
   separator one must use `%x2C` as it would otherwise be parsed as
   next option. If separator option is given multiple times only the
   last one is used. E.g., `%(trailers:key=Ticket,separator=%x2C )`
   shows all trailer lines whose key is "Ticket" separated by a comma
   and a space.
** 'unfold[=val]': make it behave as if interpret-trailer's `--unfold`
   option was given. In same way as to for `only` it can be followed
   by an equal sign and explicit value. E.g.,
   `%(trailers:only,unfold=true)` unfolds and shows all trailer lines.
** 'valueonly[=val]': skip over the key part of the trailer line and only
   show the value part. Also this optionally allows explicit value.

NOTE: Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the
revision traversal engine. For example, the `%g*` reflog options will
insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by
`git log -g`). The `%d` and `%D` placeholders will use the "short"
decoration format if `--decorate` was not already provided on the command
line.

If you add a `+` (plus sign) after '%' of a placeholder, a line-feed
is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

If you add a `-` (minus sign) after '%' of a placeholder, all consecutive
line-feeds immediately preceding the expansion are deleted if and only if the
placeholder expands to an empty string.

If you add a ` ` (space) after '%' of a placeholder, a space
is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

* 'tformat:'
+
The 'tformat:' format works exactly like 'format:', except that it
provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics. In
other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a
newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries.
This means that the final entry of a single-line format will be properly
terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does.
For example:
+
---------------------
$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973
---------------------
+
In addition, any unrecognized string that has a `%` in it is interpreted
as if it has `tformat:` in front of it.  For example, these two are
equivalent:
+
---------------------
$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
$ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef
---------------------



COMMON DIFF OPTIONS
-------------------

:git-log: 1
// Please don't remove this comment as asciidoc behaves badly when
// the first non-empty line is ifdef/ifndef. The symptom is that
// without this comment the <git-diff-core> attribute conditionally
// defined below ends up being defined unconditionally.
// Last checked with asciidoc 7.0.2.

:git-diff-core: 1
endif::git-log[]
endif::git-diff[]
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifdef::git-format-patch[]
-p::
--no-stat::
	Generate plain patches without any diffstats.
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
-p::
-u::
--patch::
	Generate patch (see section on generating patches).
ifdef::git-diff[]
	This is the default.
endif::git-diff[]

-s::
--no-patch::
	Suppress diff output. Useful for commands like `git show` that
	show the patch by default, or to cancel the effect of `--patch`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

-U<n>::
--unified=<n>::
	Generate diffs with <n> lines of context instead of
	the usual three. Implies `--patch`.
ifndef::git-format-patch[]
	Implies `-p`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--output=<file>::
	Output to a specific file instead of stdout.

--output-indicator-new=<char>::
--output-indicator-old=<char>::
--output-indicator-context=<char>::
	Specify the character used to indicate new, old or context
	lines in the generated patch. Normally they are '+', '-' and
	' ' respectively.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--raw::
ifndef::git-log[]
	Generate the diff in raw format.
ifdef::git-diff-core[]
	This is the default.
endif::git-diff-core[]
endif::git-log[]
ifdef::git-log[]
	For each commit, show a summary of changes using the raw diff
	format. See the "RAW OUTPUT FORMAT" section of
	linkgit:git-diff[1]. This is different from showing the log
	itself in raw format, which you can achieve with
	`--format=raw`.
endif::git-log[]
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--patch-with-raw::
	Synonym for `-p --raw`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--indent-heuristic::
	Enable the heuristic that shifts diff hunk boundaries to make patches
	easier to read. This is the default.

--no-indent-heuristic::
	Disable the indent heuristic.

--minimal::
	Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible
	diff is produced.

--patience::
	Generate a diff using the "patience diff" algorithm.

--histogram::
	Generate a diff using the "histogram diff" algorithm.

--anchored=<text>::
	Generate a diff using the "anchored diff" algorithm.
+
This option may be specified more than once.
+
If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only once,
and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from
appearing as a deletion or addition in the output. It uses the "patience
diff" algorithm internally.

--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}::
	Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:
+
--
`default`, `myers`;;
	The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the default.
`minimal`;;
	Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
	produced.
`patience`;;
	Use "patience diff" algorithm when generating patches.
`histogram`;;
	This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to "support
	low-occurrence common elements".
--
+
For instance, if you configured the `diff.algorithm` variable to a
non-default value and want to use the default one, then you
have to use `--diff-algorithm=default` option.

--stat[=<width>[,<name-width>[,<count>]]]::
	Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary
	will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph
	part. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns
	if not connected to a terminal, and can be overridden by
	`<width>`. The width of the filename part can be limited by
	giving another width `<name-width>` after a comma. The width
	of the graph part can be limited by using
	`--stat-graph-width=<width>` (affects all commands generating
	a stat graph) or by setting `diff.statGraphWidth=<width>`
	(does not affect `git format-patch`).
	By giving a third parameter `<count>`, you can limit the
	output to the first `<count>` lines, followed by `...` if
	there are more.
+
These parameters can also be set individually with `--stat-width=<width>`,
`--stat-name-width=<name-width>` and `--stat-count=<count>`.

--compact-summary::
	Output a condensed summary of extended header information such
	as file creations or deletions ("new" or "gone", optionally "+l"
	if it's a symlink) and mode changes ("+x" or "-x" for adding
	or removing executable bit respectively) in diffstat. The
	information is put between the filename part and the graph
	part. Implies `--stat`.

--numstat::
	Similar to `--stat`, but shows number of added and
	deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without
	abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly.  For
	binary files, outputs two `-` instead of saying
	`0 0`.

--shortstat::
	Output only the last line of the `--stat` format containing total
	number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted
	lines.

-X[<param1,param2,...>]::
--dirstat[=<param1,param2,...>]::
	Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each
	sub-directory. The behavior of `--dirstat` can be customized by
	passing it a comma separated list of parameters.
	The defaults are controlled by the `diff.dirstat` configuration
	variable (see linkgit:git-config[1]).
	The following parameters are available:
+
--
`changes`;;
	Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been
	removed from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores
	the amount of pure code movements within a file.  In other words,
	rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes.
	This is the default behavior when no parameter is given.
`lines`;;
	Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
	analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary
	files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no
	natural concept of lines). This is a more expensive `--dirstat`
	behavior than the `changes` behavior, but it does count rearranged
	lines within a file as much as other changes. The resulting output
	is consistent with what you get from the other `--*stat` options.
`files`;;
	Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed.
	Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is
	the computationally cheapest `--dirstat` behavior, since it does
	not have to look at the file contents at all.
`cumulative`;;
	Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well.
	Note that when using `cumulative`, the sum of the percentages
	reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can
	be specified with the `noncumulative` parameter.
<limit>;;
	An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
	Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes
	are not shown in the output.
--
+
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files,
and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
`--dirstat=files,10,cumulative`.

--cumulative::
	Synonym for --dirstat=cumulative

--dirstat-by-file[=<param1,param2>...]::
	Synonym for --dirstat=files,param1,param2...

--summary::
	Output a condensed summary of extended header information
	such as creations, renames and mode changes.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--patch-with-stat::
	Synonym for `-p --stat`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]

-z::
ifdef::git-log[]
	Separate the commits with NULs instead of with new newlines.
+
Also, when `--raw` or `--numstat` has been given, do not munge
pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.
endif::git-log[]
ifndef::git-log[]
	When `--raw`, `--numstat`, `--name-only` or `--name-status` has been
	given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.
endif::git-log[]
+
Without this option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as
explained for the configuration variable `core.quotePath` (see
linkgit:git-config[1]).

--name-only::
	Show only names of changed files.

--name-status::
	Show only names and status of changed files. See the description
	of the `--diff-filter` option on what the status letters mean.

--submodule[=<format>]::
	Specify how differences in submodules are shown.  When specifying
	`--submodule=short` the 'short' format is used.  This format just
	shows the names of the commits at the beginning and end of the range.
	When `--submodule` or `--submodule=log` is specified, the 'log'
	format is used.  This format lists the commits in the range like
	linkgit:git-submodule[1] `summary` does.  When `--submodule=diff`
	is specified, the 'diff' format is used.  This format shows an
	inline diff of the changes in the submodule contents between the
	commit range.  Defaults to `diff.submodule` or the 'short' format
	if the config option is unset.

--color[=<when>]::
	Show colored diff.
	`--color` (i.e. without '=<when>') is the same as `--color=always`.
	'<when>' can be one of `always`, `never`, or `auto`.
ifdef::git-diff[]
	It can be changed by the `color.ui` and `color.diff`
	configuration settings.
endif::git-diff[]

--no-color::
	Turn off colored diff.
ifdef::git-diff[]
	This can be used to override configuration settings.
endif::git-diff[]
	It is the same as `--color=never`.

--color-moved[=<mode>]::
	Moved lines of code are colored differently.
ifdef::git-diff[]
	It can be changed by the `diff.colorMoved` configuration setting.
endif::git-diff[]
	The <mode> defaults to 'no' if the option is not given
	and to 'zebra' if the option with no mode is given.
	The mode must be one of:
+
--
no::
	Moved lines are not highlighted.
default::
	Is a synonym for `zebra`. This may change to a more sensible mode
	in the future.
plain::
	Any line that is added in one location and was removed
	in another location will be colored with 'color.diff.newMoved'.
	Similarly 'color.diff.oldMoved' will be used for removed lines
	that are added somewhere else in the diff. This mode picks up any
	moved line, but it is not very useful in a review to determine
	if a block of code was moved without permutation.
blocks::
	Blocks of moved text of at least 20 alphanumeric characters
	are detected greedily. The detected blocks are
	painted using either the 'color.diff.{old,new}Moved' color.
	Adjacent blocks cannot be told apart.
zebra::
	Blocks of moved text are detected as in 'blocks' mode. The blocks
	are painted using either the 'color.diff.{old,new}Moved' color or
	'color.diff.{old,new}MovedAlternative'. The change between
	the two colors indicates that a new block was detected.
dimmed-zebra::
	Similar to 'zebra', but additional dimming of uninteresting parts
	of moved code is performed. The bordering lines of two adjacent
	blocks are considered interesting, the rest is uninteresting.
	`dimmed_zebra` is a deprecated synonym.
--

--no-color-moved::
	Turn off move detection. This can be used to override configuration
	settings. It is the same as `--color-moved=no`.

--color-moved-ws=<modes>::
	This configures how whitespace is ignored when performing the
	move detection for `--color-moved`.
ifdef::git-diff[]
	It can be set by the `diff.colorMovedWS` configuration setting.
endif::git-diff[]
	These modes can be given as a comma separated list:
+
--
no::
	Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection.
ignore-space-at-eol::
	Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.
ignore-space-change::
	Ignore changes in amount of whitespace.  This ignores whitespace
	at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or
	more whitespace characters to be equivalent.
ignore-all-space::
	Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences
	even if one line has whitespace where the other line has none.
allow-indentation-change::
	Initially ignore any whitespace in the move detection, then
	group the moved code blocks only into a block if the change in
	whitespace is the same per line. This is incompatible with the
	other modes.
--

--no-color-moved-ws::
	Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection. This can be
	used to override configuration settings. It is the same as
	`--color-moved-ws=no`.

--word-diff[=<mode>]::
	Show a word diff, using the <mode> to delimit changed words.
	By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
	`--word-diff-regex` below.  The <mode> defaults to 'plain', and
	must be one of:
+
--
color::
	Highlight changed words using only colors.  Implies `--color`.
plain::
	Show words as `[-removed-]` and `{+added+}`.  Makes no
	attempts to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input,
	so the output may be ambiguous.
porcelain::
	Use a special line-based format intended for script
	consumption.  Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the
	usual unified diff format, starting with a `+`/`-`/` `
	character at the beginning of the line and extending to the
	end of the line.  Newlines in the input are represented by a
	tilde `~` on a line of its own.
none::
	Disable word diff again.
--
+
Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to
highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled.

--word-diff-regex=<regex>::
	Use <regex> to decide what a word is, instead of considering
	runs of non-whitespace to be a word.  Also implies
	`--word-diff` unless it was already enabled.
+
Every non-overlapping match of the
<regex> is considered a word.  Anything between these matches is
considered whitespace and ignored(!) for the purposes of finding
differences.  You may want to append `|[^[:space:]]` to your regular
expression to make sure that it matches all non-whitespace characters.
A match that contains a newline is silently truncated(!) at the
newline.
+
For example, `--word-diff-regex=.` will treat each character as a word
and, correspondingly, show differences character by character.
+
The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration option, see
linkgit:gitattributes[5] or linkgit:git-config[1].  Giving it explicitly
overrides any diff driver or configuration setting.  Diff drivers
override configuration settings.

--color-words[=<regex>]::
	Equivalent to `--word-diff=color` plus (if a regex was
	specified) `--word-diff-regex=<regex>`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--no-renames::
	Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration
	file gives the default to do so.

--[no-]rename-empty::
	Whether to use empty blobs as rename source.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--check::
	Warn if changes introduce conflict markers or whitespace errors.
	What are considered whitespace errors is controlled by `core.whitespace`
	configuration.  By default, trailing whitespaces (including
	lines that consist solely of whitespaces) and a space character
	that is immediately followed by a tab character inside the
	initial indent of the line are considered whitespace errors.
	Exits with non-zero status if problems are found. Not compatible
	with --exit-code.

--ws-error-highlight=<kind>::
	Highlight whitespace errors in the `context`, `old` or `new`
	lines of the diff.  Multiple values are separated by comma,
	`none` resets previous values, `default` reset the list to
	`new` and `all` is a shorthand for `old,new,context`.  When
	this option is not given, and the configuration variable
	`diff.wsErrorHighlight` is not set, only whitespace errors in
	`new` lines are highlighted. The whitespace errors are colored
	with `color.diff.whitespace`.

endif::git-format-patch[]

--full-index::
	Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
	pre- and post-image blob object names on the "index"
	line when generating patch format output.

--binary::
	In addition to `--full-index`, output a binary diff that
	can be applied with `git-apply`. Implies `--patch`.

--abbrev[=<n>]::
	Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object
	name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header
	lines, show only a partial prefix.  This is
	independent of the `--full-index` option above, which controls
	the diff-patch output format.  Non default number of
	digits can be specified with `--abbrev=<n>`.

-B[<n>][/<m>]::
--break-rewrites[=[<n>][/<m>]]::
	Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
	create. This serves two purposes:
+
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file
not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very
few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a
single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of
everything new, and the number `m` controls this aspect of the -B
option (defaults to 60%). `-B/70%` specifies that less than 30% of the
original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total
rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of
deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines).
+
When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the
source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared
as the source of a rename), and the number `n` controls this aspect of
the -B option (defaults to 50%). `-B20%` specifies that a change with
addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file's size are
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to
another file.

-M[<n>]::
--find-renames[=<n>]::
ifndef::git-log[]
	Detect renames.
endif::git-log[]
ifdef::git-log[]
	If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit.
	For following files across renames while traversing history, see
	`--follow`.
endif::git-log[]
	If `n` is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
	index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the
	file's size). For example, `-M90%` means Git should consider a
	delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file
	hasn't changed.  Without a `%` sign, the number is to be read as
	a fraction, with a decimal point before it.  I.e., `-M5` becomes
	0.5, and is thus the same as `-M50%`.  Similarly, `-M05` is
	the same as `-M5%`.  To limit detection to exact renames, use
	`-M100%`.  The default similarity index is 50%.

-C[<n>]::
--find-copies[=<n>]::
	Detect copies as well as renames.  See also `--find-copies-harder`.
	If `n` is specified, it has the same meaning as for `-M<n>`.

--find-copies-harder::
	For performance reasons, by default, `-C` option finds copies only
	if the original file of the copy was modified in the same
	changeset.  This flag makes the command
	inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of
	copy.  This is a very expensive operation for large
	projects, so use it with caution.  Giving more than one
	`-C` option has the same effect.

-D::
--irreversible-delete::
	Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not
	the diff between the preimage and `/dev/null`. The resulting patch
	is not meant to be applied with `patch` or `git apply`; this is
	solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the
	text after the change. In addition, the output obviously lacks
	enough information to apply such a patch in reverse, even manually,
	hence the name of the option.
+
When used together with `-B`, omit also the preimage in the deletion part
of a delete/create pair.

-l<num>::
	The `-M` and `-C` options require O(n^2) processing time where n
	is the number of potential rename/copy targets.  This
	option prevents rename/copy detection from running if
	the number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified
	number.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]::
	Select only files that are Added (`A`), Copied (`C`),
	Deleted (`D`), Modified (`M`), Renamed (`R`), have their
	type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (`T`),
	are Unmerged (`U`), are
	Unknown (`X`), or have had their pairing Broken (`B`).
	Any combination of the filter characters (including none) can be used.
	When `*` (All-or-none) is added to the combination, all
	paths are selected if there is any file that matches
	other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file
	that matches other criteria, nothing is selected.
+
Also, these upper-case letters can be downcased to exclude.  E.g.
`--diff-filter=ad` excludes added and deleted paths.
+
Note that not all diffs can feature all types. For instance, diffs
from the index to the working tree can never have Added entries
(because the set of paths included in the diff is limited by what is in
the index).  Similarly, copied and renamed entries cannot appear if
detection for those types is disabled.

-S<string>::
	Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of
	the specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file.
	Intended for the scripter's use.
+
It is useful when you're looking for an exact block of code (like a
struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first
came into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting
block in the preimage back into `-S`, and keep going until you get the
very first version of the block.
+
Binary files are searched as well.

-G<regex>::
	Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed
	lines that match <regex>.
+
To illustrate the difference between `-S<regex> --pickaxe-regex` and
`-G<regex>`, consider a commit with the following diff in the same
file:
+
----
+    return frotz(nitfol, two->ptr, 1, 0);
...
-    hit = frotz(nitfol, mf2.ptr, 1, 0);
----
+
While `git log -G"frotz\(nitfol"` will show this commit, `git log
-S"frotz\(nitfol" --pickaxe-regex` will not (because the number of
occurrences of that string did not change).
+
Unless `--text` is supplied patches of binary files without a textconv
filter will be ignored.
+
See the 'pickaxe' entry in linkgit:gitdiffcore[7] for more
information.

--find-object=<object-id>::
	Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of
	the specified object. Similar to `-S`, just the argument is different
	in that it doesn't search for a specific string but for a specific
	object id.
+
The object can be a blob or a submodule commit. It implies the `-t` option in
`git-log` to also find trees.

--pickaxe-all::
	When `-S` or `-G` finds a change, show all the changes in that
	changeset, not just the files that contain the change
	in <string>.

--pickaxe-regex::
	Treat the <string> given to `-S` as an extended POSIX regular
	expression to match.

endif::git-format-patch[]

-O<orderfile>::
	Control the order in which files appear in the output.
	This overrides the `diff.orderFile` configuration variable
	(see linkgit:git-config[1]).  To cancel `diff.orderFile`,
	use `-O/dev/null`.
+
The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in
<orderfile>.
All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are output
first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern (but not
the first) are output next, and so on.
All files with pathnames that do not match any pattern are output
last, as if there was an implicit match-all pattern at the end of the
file.
If multiple pathnames have the same rank (they match the same pattern
but no earlier patterns), their output order relative to each other is
the normal order.
+
<orderfile> is parsed as follows:
+
--
 - Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as separators for
   readability.

 - Lines starting with a hash ("`#`") are ignored, so they can be used
   for comments.  Add a backslash ("`\`") to the beginning of the
   pattern if it starts with a hash.

 - Each other line contains a single pattern.
--
+
Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for
fnmatch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also
matches a pattern if removing any number of the final pathname
components matches the pattern.  For example, the pattern "`foo*bar`"
matches "`fooasdfbar`" and "`foo/bar/baz/asdf`" but not "`foobarx`".

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
-R::
	Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or
	on-disk file to tree contents.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--relative[=<path>]::
--no-relative::
	When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be
	told to exclude changes outside the directory and show
	pathnames relative to it with this option.  When you are
	not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare repository), you
	can name which subdirectory to make the output relative
	to by giving a <path> as an argument.
	`--no-relative` can be used to countermand both `diff.relative` config
	option and previous `--relative`.

-a::
--text::
	Treat all files as text.

--ignore-cr-at-eol::
	Ignore carriage-return at the end of line when doing a comparison.

--ignore-space-at-eol::
	Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.

-b::
--ignore-space-change::
	Ignore changes in amount of whitespace.  This ignores whitespace
	at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or
	more whitespace characters to be equivalent.

-w::
--ignore-all-space::
	Ignore whitespace when comparing lines.  This ignores
	differences even if one line has whitespace where the other
	line has none.

--ignore-blank-lines::
	Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.

--inter-hunk-context=<lines>::
	Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number
	of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other.
	Defaults to `diff.interHunkContext` or 0 if the config option
	is unset.

-W::
--function-context::
	Show whole surrounding functions of changes.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
ifndef::git-log[]
--exit-code::
	Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1).
	That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and
	0 means no differences.

--quiet::
	Disable all output of the program. Implies `--exit-code`.
endif::git-log[]
endif::git-format-patch[]

--ext-diff::
	Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an
	external diff driver with linkgit:gitattributes[5], you need
	to use this option with linkgit:git-log[1] and friends.

--no-ext-diff::
	Disallow external diff drivers.

--textconv::
--no-textconv::
	Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be run
	when comparing binary files. See linkgit:gitattributes[5] for
	details. Because textconv filters are typically a one-way
	conversion, the resulting diff is suitable for human
	consumption, but cannot be applied. For this reason, textconv
	filters are enabled by default only for linkgit:git-diff[1] and
	linkgit:git-log[1], but not for linkgit:git-format-patch[1] or
	diff plumbing commands.

--ignore-submodules[=<when>]::
	Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation. <when> can be
	either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the default.
	Using "none" will consider the submodule modified when it either contains
	untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded
	in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the
	'ignore' option in linkgit:git-config[1] or linkgit:gitmodules[5]. When
	"untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only
	contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
	content). Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules,
	only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was
	the behavior until 1.7.0). Using "all" hides all changes to submodules.

--src-prefix=<prefix>::
	Show the given source prefix instead of "a/".

--dst-prefix=<prefix>::
	Show the given destination prefix instead of "b/".

--no-prefix::
	Do not show any source or destination prefix.

--line-prefix=<prefix>::
	Prepend an additional prefix to every line of output.

--ita-invisible-in-index::
	By default entries added by "git add -N" appear as an existing
	empty file in "git diff" and a new file in "git diff --cached".
	This option makes the entry appear as a new file in "git diff"
	and non-existent in "git diff --cached". This option could be
	reverted with `--ita-visible-in-index`. Both options are
	experimental and could be removed in future.

For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also
linkgit:gitdiffcore[7].


Generating patch text with -p
-----------------------------

Running
linkgit:git-diff[1],
linkgit:git-log[1],
linkgit:git-show[1],
linkgit:git-diff-index[1],
linkgit:git-diff-tree[1], or
linkgit:git-diff-files[1]
with the `-p` option produces patch text.
You can customize the creation of patch text via the
`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` and the `GIT_DIFF_OPTS` environment variables.

What the -p option produces is slightly different from the traditional
diff format:

1.   It is preceded with a "git diff" header that looks like this:

       diff --git a/file1 b/file2
+
The `a/` and `b/` filenames are the same unless rename/copy is
involved.  Especially, even for a creation or a deletion,
`/dev/null` is _not_ used in place of the `a/` or `b/` filenames.
+
When rename/copy is involved, `file1` and `file2` show the
name of the source file of the rename/copy and the name of
the file that rename/copy produces, respectively.

2.   It is followed by one or more extended header lines:

       old mode <mode>
       new mode <mode>
       deleted file mode <mode>
       new file mode <mode>
       copy from <path>
       copy to <path>
       rename from <path>
       rename to <path>
       similarity index <number>
       dissimilarity index <number>
       index <hash>..<hash> <mode>
+
File modes are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file type
and file permission bits.
+
Path names in extended headers do not include the `a/` and `b/` prefixes.
+
The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and
the dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines.  It
is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign.  The
similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal
files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line from the old
file made it into the new one.
+
The index line includes the blob object names before and after the change.
The <mode> is included if the file mode does not change; otherwise,
separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.

3.  Pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as explained for
    the configuration variable `core.quotePath` (see
    linkgit:git-config[1]).

4.  All the `file1` files in the output refer to files before the
    commit, and all the `file2` files refer to files after the commit.
    It is incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially.  For
    example, this patch will swap a and b:

      diff --git a/a b/b
      rename from a
      rename to b
      diff --git a/b b/a
      rename from b
      rename to a


Combined diff format
--------------------

Any diff-generating command can take the `-c` or `--cc` option to
produce a 'combined diff' when showing a merge. This is the default
format when showing merges with linkgit:git-diff[1] or
linkgit:git-show[1]. Note also that you can give the `-m` option to any
of these commands to force generation of diffs with individual parents
of a merge.

A "combined diff" format looks like this:

------------
diff --combined describe.c
index fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510
--- a/describe.c
+++ b/describe.c
@@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@
	return (a_date > b_date) ? -1 : (a_date == b_date) ? 0 : 1;
  }

- static void describe(char *arg)
 -static void describe(struct commit *cmit, int last_one)
++static void describe(char *arg, int last_one)
  {
 +	unsigned char sha1[20];
 +	struct commit *cmit;
	struct commit_list *list;
	static int initialized = 0;
	struct commit_name *n;

 +	if (get_sha1(arg, sha1) < 0)
 +		usage(describe_usage);
 +	cmit = lookup_commit_reference(sha1);
 +	if (!cmit)
 +		usage(describe_usage);
 +
	if (!initialized) {
		initialized = 1;
		for_each_ref(get_name);
------------

1.   It is preceded with a "git diff" header, that looks like
     this (when the `-c` option is used):

       diff --combined file
+
or like this (when the `--cc` option is used):

       diff --cc file

2.   It is followed by one or more extended header lines
     (this example shows a merge with two parents):

       index <hash>,<hash>..<hash>
       mode <mode>,<mode>..<mode>
       new file mode <mode>
       deleted file mode <mode>,<mode>
+
The `mode <mode>,<mode>..<mode>` line appears only if at least one of
the <mode> is different from the rest. Extended headers with
information about detected contents movement (renames and
copying detection) are designed to work with diff of two
<tree-ish> and are not used by combined diff format.

3.   It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file header

       --- a/file
       +++ b/file
+
Similar to two-line header for traditional 'unified' diff
format, `/dev/null` is used to signal created or deleted
files.
+
However, if the --combined-all-paths option is provided, instead of a
two-line from-file/to-file you get a N+1 line from-file/to-file header,
where N is the number of parents in the merge commit

       --- a/file
       --- a/file
       --- a/file
       +++ b/file
+
This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is
active, to allow you to see the original name of the file in different
parents.

4.   Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from
     accidentally feeding it to `patch -p1`. Combined diff format
     was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not
     meant to be applied. The change is similar to the change in the
     extended 'index' header:

       @@@ <from-file-range> <from-file-range> <to-file-range> @@@
+
There are (number of parents + 1) `@` characters in the chunk
header for combined diff format.

Unlike the traditional 'unified' diff format, which shows two
files A and B with a single column that has `-` (minus --
appears in A but removed in B), `+` (plus -- missing in A but
added to B), or `" "` (space -- unchanged) prefix, this format
compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one file X, and
shows how X differs from each of fileN.  One column for each of
fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X's line is
different from it.

A `-` character in the column N means that the line appears in
fileN but it does not appear in the result.  A `+` character
in the column N means that the line appears in the result,
and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was
added, from the point of view of that parent).

In the above example output, the function signature was changed
from both files (hence two `-` removals from both file1 and
file2, plus `++` to mean one line that was added does not appear
in either file1 or file2).  Also eight other lines are the same
from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with `+`).

When shown by `git diff-tree -c`, it compares the parents of a
merge commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the
parents).  When shown by `git diff-files -c`, it compares the
two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file
(i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka
"their version").



EXAMPLES
--------

`git show v1.0.0`::
	Shows the tag `v1.0.0`, along with the object the tags
	points at.

`git show v1.0.0^{tree}`::
	Shows the tree pointed to by the tag `v1.0.0`.

`git show -s --format=%s v1.0.0^{commit}`::
	Shows the subject of the commit pointed to by the
	tag `v1.0.0`.

`git show next~10:Documentation/README`::
	Shows the contents of the file `Documentation/README` as
	they were current in the 10th last commit of the branch
	`next`.

`git show master:Makefile master:t/Makefile`::
	Concatenates the contents of said Makefiles in the head
	of the branch `master`.

DISCUSSION
----------

Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.

 - The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences
   of bytes.  There is no encoding translation at the core
   level.

 - Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This
   applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as
   path names in command line arguments, environment variables
   and config files (`.git/config` (see linkgit:git-config[1]),
   linkgit:gitignore[5], linkgit:gitattributes[5] and
   linkgit:gitmodules[5]).
+
Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as
sequences of non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding
conversions (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using
non-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file
systems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings. However,
repositories created on such systems will not work properly on
UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa.
Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to
be UTF-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly.

 - Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other
   extended ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes
   ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but _not_ UTF-16/32,
   EBCDIC and CJK multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5,
   EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).

Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded
in UTF-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to
force UTF-8 on projects.  If all participants of a particular
project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git
does not forbid it.  However, there are a few things to keep in
mind.

. 'git commit' and 'git commit-tree' issues
  a warning if the commit log message given to it does not look
  like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you explicitly say your
  project uses a legacy encoding.  The way to say this is to
  have i18n.commitencoding in `.git/config` file, like this:
+
------------
[i18n]
	commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1
------------
+
Commit objects created with the above setting record the value
of `i18n.commitEncoding` in its `encoding` header.  This is to
help other people who look at them later.  Lack of this header
implies that the commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.

. 'git log', 'git show', 'git blame' and friends look at the
  `encoding` header of a commit object, and try to re-code the
  log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified.  You can
  specify the desired output encoding with
  `i18n.logOutputEncoding` in `.git/config` file, like this:
+
------------
[i18n]
	logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1
------------
+
If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
`i18n.commitEncoding` is used instead.

Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log
message when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit
object level, because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a
reversible operation.
