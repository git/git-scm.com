NAME
----
git-log - Show commit logs


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git log' [<options>] [<revision range>] [[\--] <path>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the commit logs.

The command takes options applicable to the `git rev-list`
command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to
the `git diff-*` commands to control how the changes
each commit introduces are shown.


OPTIONS
-------

--follow::
	Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames
	(works only for a single file).

--no-decorate::
--decorate[=short|full|no]::
	Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown. If 'short' is
	specified, the ref name prefixes 'refs/heads/', 'refs/tags/' and
	'refs/remotes/' will not be printed. If 'full' is specified, the
	full ref name (including prefix) will be printed. The default option
	is 'short'.

--source::
	Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each
	commit was reached.

--use-mailmap::
	Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and email
	addresses to canonical real names and email addresses. See
	linkgit:git-shortlog[1].

--full-diff::
	Without this flag, `git log -p <path>...` shows commits that
	touch the specified paths, and diffs about the same specified
	paths.  With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch
	the specified paths; this means that "<path>..." limits only
	commits, and doesn't limit diff for those commits.
+
Note that this affects all diff-based output types, e.g. those
produced by `--stat`, etc.

--log-size::
	Include a line ``log size <number>'' in the output for each commit,
	where <number> is the length of that commit's message in bytes.
	Intended to speed up tools that read log messages from `git log`
	output by allowing them to allocate space in advance.

-L <start>,<end>:<file>::
-L :<funcname>:<file>::
	Trace the evolution of the line range given by "<start>,<end>"
	(or the function name regex <funcname>) within the <file>.  You may
	not give any pathspec limiters.  This is currently limited to
	a walk starting from a single revision, i.e., you may only
	give zero or one positive revision arguments.
	You can specify this option more than once.
+
<start> and <end> can take one of these forms:

- number
+
If <start> or <end> is a number, it specifies an
absolute line number (lines count from 1).
+

- /regex/
+
This form will use the first line matching the given
POSIX regex. If <start> is a regex, it will search from the end of
the previous `-L` range, if any, otherwise from the start of file.
If <start> is ``^/regex/'', it will search from the start of file.
If <end> is a regex, it will search
starting at the line given by <start>.
+

- +offset or -offset
+
This is only valid for <end> and will specify a number
of lines before or after the line given by <start>.

+
If ``:<funcname>'' is given in place of <start> and <end>, it is a
regular expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line
that matches <funcname>, up to the next funcname line. ``:<funcname>''
searches from the end of the previous `-L` range, if any, otherwise
from the start of file. ``^:<funcname>'' searches from the start of
file.


<revision range>::
	Show only commits in the specified revision range.  When no
	<revision range> is specified, it defaults to `HEAD` (i.e. the
	whole history leading to the current commit).  `origin..HEAD`
	specifies all the commits reachable from the current commit
	(i.e. `HEAD`), but not from `origin`. For a complete list of
	ways to spell <revision range>, see the 'Specifying Ranges'
	section of linkgit:gitrevisions[7].

[\--] <path>...::
	Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files
	that match the specified paths came to be.  See 'History
	Simplification' below for details and other simplification
	modes.
+
Paths may need to be prefixed with ``\-- '' to separate them from
options or the revision range, when confusion arises.

Commit Limiting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the
special notations explained in the description, additional commit
limiting may be applied.

Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
`--since=<date1>` limits to commits newer than `<date1>`, and using it
with `--grep=<pattern>` further limits to commits whose log message
has a line that matches `<pattern>`), unless otherwise noted.

Note that these are applied before commit
ordering and formatting options, such as `--reverse`.

--

-<number>::
-n <number>::
--max-count=<number>::
	Limit the number of commits to output.

--skip=<number>::
	Skip 'number' commits before starting to show the commit output.

--since=<date>::
--after=<date>::
	Show commits more recent than a specific date.

--until=<date>::
--before=<date>::
	Show commits older than a specific date.

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
--max-age=<timestamp>::
--min-age=<timestamp>::
	Limit the commits output to specified time range.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--author=<pattern>::
--committer=<pattern>::
	Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer
	header lines that match the specified pattern (regular
	expression).  With more than one `--author=<pattern>`,
	commits whose author matches any of the given patterns are
	chosen (similarly for multiple `--committer=<pattern>`).

--grep-reflog=<pattern>::
	Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that
	match the specified pattern (regular expression). With
	more than one `--grep-reflog`, commits whose reflog message
	matches any of the given patterns are chosen.  It is an
	error to use this option unless `--walk-reflogs` is in use.

--grep=<pattern>::
	Limit the commits output to ones with log message that
	matches the specified pattern (regular expression).  With
	more than one `--grep=<pattern>`, commits whose message
	matches any of the given patterns are chosen (but see
	`--all-match`).
ifndef::git-rev-list[]
+
When `--show-notes` is in effect, the message from the notes is
matched as if it were part of the log message.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--all-match::
	Limit the commits output to ones that match all given `--grep`,
	instead of ones that match at least one.

--invert-grep::
	Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do not
	match the pattern specified with `--grep=<pattern>`.

-i::
--regexp-ignore-case::
	Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter
	case.

--basic-regexp::
	Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions;
	this is the default.

-E::
--extended-regexp::
	Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions
	instead of the default basic regular expressions.

-F::
--fixed-strings::
	Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don't interpret
	pattern as a regular expression).

--perl-regexp::
	Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible regular expressions.
	Requires libpcre to be compiled in.

--remove-empty::
	Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.

--merges::
	Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as `--min-parents=2`.

--no-merges::
	Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is
	exactly the same as `--max-parents=1`.

--min-parents=<number>::
--max-parents=<number>::
--no-min-parents::
--no-max-parents::
	Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent
	commits. In particular, `--max-parents=1` is the same as `--no-merges`,
	`--min-parents=2` is the same as `--merges`.  `--max-parents=0`
	gives all root commits and `--min-parents=3` all octopus merges.
+
`--no-min-parents` and `--no-max-parents` reset these limits (to no limit)
again.  Equivalent forms are `--min-parents=0` (any commit has 0 or more
parents) and `--max-parents=-1` (negative numbers denote no upper limit).

--first-parent::
	Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge
	commit.  This option can give a better overview when
	viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch,
	because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about
	adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and
	this option allows you to ignore the individual commits
	brought in to your history by such a merge. Cannot be
	combined with --bisect.

--not::
	Reverses the meaning of the '{caret}' prefix (or lack thereof)
	for all following revision specifiers, up to the next `--not`.

--all::
	Pretend as if all the refs in `refs/` are listed on the
	command line as '<commit>'.

--branches[=<pattern>]::
	Pretend as if all the refs in `refs/heads` are listed
	on the command line as '<commit>'. If '<pattern>' is given, limit
	branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks '?',
	'{asterisk}', or '[', '/{asterisk}' at the end is implied.

--tags[=<pattern>]::
	Pretend as if all the refs in `refs/tags` are listed
	on the command line as '<commit>'. If '<pattern>' is given, limit
	tags to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks '?', '{asterisk}',
	or '[', '/{asterisk}' at the end is implied.

--remotes[=<pattern>]::
	Pretend as if all the refs in `refs/remotes` are listed
	on the command line as '<commit>'. If '<pattern>' is given, limit
	remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob.
	If pattern lacks '?', '{asterisk}', or '[', '/{asterisk}' at the end is implied.

--glob=<glob-pattern>::
	Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob '<glob-pattern>'
	are listed on the command line as '<commit>'. Leading 'refs/',
	is automatically prepended if missing. If pattern lacks '?', '{asterisk}',
	or '[', '/{asterisk}' at the end is implied.

--exclude=<glob-pattern>::

	Do not include refs matching '<glob-pattern>' that the next `--all`,
	`--branches`, `--tags`, `--remotes`, or `--glob` would otherwise
	consider. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns
	up to the next `--all`, `--branches`, `--tags`, `--remotes`, or
	`--glob` option (other options or arguments do not clear
	accumulated patterns).
+
The patterns given should not begin with `refs/heads`, `refs/tags`, or
`refs/remotes` when applied to `--branches`, `--tags`, or `--remotes`,
respectively, and they must begin with `refs/` when applied to `--glob`
or `--all`. If a trailing '/{asterisk}' is intended, it must be given
explicitly.

--reflog::
	Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on the
	command line as `<commit>`.

--ignore-missing::
	Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if
	the bad input was not given.

ifndef::git-rev-list[]
--bisect::
	Pretend as if the bad bisection ref `refs/bisect/bad`
	was listed and as if it was followed by `--not` and the good
	bisection refs `refs/bisect/good-*` on the command
	line. Cannot be combined with --first-parent.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--stdin::
	In addition to the '<commit>' listed on the command
	line, read them from the standard input. If a '--' separator is
	seen, stop reading commits and start reading paths to limit the
	result.

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
--quiet::
	Don't print anything to standard output.  This form
	is primarily meant to allow the caller to
	test the exit status to see if a range of objects is fully
	connected (or not).  It is faster than redirecting stdout
	to `/dev/null` as the output does not have to be formatted.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--cherry-mark::
	Like `--cherry-pick` (see below) but mark equivalent commits
	with `=` rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with `+`.

--cherry-pick::
	Omit any commit that introduces the same change as
	another commit on the ``other side'' when the set of
	commits are limited with symmetric difference.
+
For example, if you have two branches, `A` and `B`, a usual way
to list all commits on only one side of them is with
`--left-right` (see the example below in the description of
the `--left-right` option). However, it shows the commits that were
cherry-picked from the other branch (for example, ``3rd on b'' may be
cherry-picked from branch A). With this option, such pairs of commits are
excluded from the output.

--left-only::
--right-only::
	List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric range,
	i.e. only those which would be marked `<` resp. `>` by
	`--left-right`.
+
For example, `--cherry-pick --right-only A...B` omits those
commits from `B` which are in `A` or are patch-equivalent to a commit in
`A`. In other words, this lists the `+` commits from `git cherry A B`.
More precisely, `--cherry-pick --right-only --no-merges` gives the exact
list.

--cherry::
	A synonym for `--right-only --cherry-mark --no-merges`; useful to
	limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that
	have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
	`git log --cherry upstream...mybranch`, similar to
	`git cherry upstream mybranch`.

-g::
--walk-reflogs::
	Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk
	reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones.
	When this option is used you cannot specify commits to
	exclude (that is, '{caret}commit', 'commit1..commit2',
	and 'commit1\...commit2' notations cannot be used).
+
With `--pretty` format other than `oneline` (for obvious reasons),
this causes the output to have two extra lines of information
taken from the reflog.  By default, 'commit@\{Nth}' notation is
used in the output.  When the starting commit is specified as
'commit@\{now}', output also uses 'commit@\{timestamp}' notation
instead.  Under `--pretty=oneline`, the commit message is
prefixed with this information on the same line.
This option cannot be combined with `--reverse`.
See also linkgit:git-reflog[1].

--merge::
	After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a
	conflict and don't exist on all heads to merge.

--boundary::
	Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are
	prefixed with `-`.

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
--use-bitmap-index::

	Try to speed up the traversal using the pack bitmap index (if
	one is available). Note that when traversing with `--objects`,
	trees and blobs will not have their associated path printed.
endif::git-rev-list[]

History Simplification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the
commits modifying a particular <path>. But there are two parts of
'History Simplification', one part is selecting the commits and the other
is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history.

The following options select the commits to be shown:

<paths>::
	Commits modifying the given <paths> are selected.

--simplify-by-decoration::
	Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected.

Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.

The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:

Default mode::
	Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the
	final state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side
	branches if the end result is the same (i.e. merging branches
	with the same content)

--full-history::
	Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history.

--dense::
	Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a
	meaningful history.

--sparse::
	All commits in the simplified history are shown.

--simplify-merges::
	Additional option to `--full-history` to remove some needless
	merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected
	commits contributing to this merge.

--ancestry-path::
	When given a range of commits to display (e.g. 'commit1..commit2'
	or 'commit2 {caret}commit1'), only display commits that exist
	directly on the ancestry chain between the 'commit1' and
	'commit2', i.e. commits that are both descendants of 'commit1',
	and ancestors of 'commit2'.

A more detailed explanation follows.

Suppose you specified `foo` as the <paths>.  We shall call commits
that modify `foo` !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME.  (In a diff
filtered for `foo`, they look different and equal, respectively.)

In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to
illustrate the differences between simplification settings.  We assume
that you are filtering for a file `foo` in this commit graph:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
	 /     /   /   /   /   /
	I     B   C   D   E   Y
	 \   /   /   /   /   /
	  `-------------'   X
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first parent of
each merge.  The commits are:

* `I` is the initial commit, in which `foo` exists with contents
  ``asdf'', and a file `quux` exists with contents ``quux''. Initial
  commits are compared to an empty tree, so `I` is !TREESAME.

* In `A`, `foo` contains just ``foo''.

* `B` contains the same change as `A`.  Its merge `M` is trivial and
  hence TREESAME to all parents.

* `C` does not change `foo`, but its merge `N` changes it to ``foobar'',
  so it is not TREESAME to any parent.

* `D` sets `foo` to ``baz''. Its merge `O` combines the strings from
  `N` and `D` to ``foobarbaz''; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.

* `E` changes `quux` to ``xyzzy'', and its merge `P` combines the
  strings to ``quux xyzzy''. `P` is TREESAME to `O`, but not to `E`.

* `X` is an independent root commit that added a new file `side`, and `Y`
  modified it. `Y` is TREESAME to `X`. Its merge `Q` added `side` to `P`, and
  `Q` is TREESAME to `P`, but not to `Y`.

`rev-list` walks backwards through history, including or excluding
commits based on whether `--full-history` and/or parent rewriting
(via `--parents` or `--children`) are used. The following settings
are available.

Default mode::
	Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent
	(though this can be changed, see `--sparse` below).  If the
	commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow
	only that parent.  (Even if there are several TREESAME
	parents, follow only one of them.)  Otherwise, follow all
	parents.
+
This results in:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  .-A---N---O
	 /     /   /
	I---------D
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
available, removed `B` from consideration entirely.  `C` was
considered via `N`, but is TREESAME.  Root commits are compared to an
empty tree, so `I` is !TREESAME.
+
Parent/child relations are only visible with `--parents`, but that does
not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the
parent lines.

--full-history without parent rewriting::
	This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow
	all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them.
	Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are
	included, this does not imply that the merge itself is!  In
	the example, we get
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
`M` was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.  `E`,
`C` and `B` were all walked, but only `B` was !TREESAME, so the others
do not appear.
+
Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
them disconnected.

--full-history with parent rewriting::
	Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME
	(though this can be changed, see `--sparse` below).
+
Merges are always included.  However, their parent list is rewritten:
Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
themselves.  This results in
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
	 /     /   /   /   /
	I     B   /   D   /
	 \   /   /   /   /
	  `-------------'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Compare to `--full-history` without rewriting above.  Note that `E`
was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was
rewritten to contain `E`'s parent `I`.  The same happened for `C` and
`N`, and `X`, `Y` and `Q`.

In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
affects inclusion:

--dense::
	Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME
	to any parent.

--sparse::
	All commits that are walked are included.
+
Note that without `--full-history`, this still simplifies merges: if
one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other
sides of the merge are never walked.

--simplify-merges::
	First, build a history graph in the same way that
	`--full-history` with parent rewriting does (see above).
+
Then simplify each commit `C` to its replacement `C'` in the final
history according to the following rules:
+
--
* Set `C'` to `C`.
+
* Replace each parent `P` of `C'` with its simplification `P'`.  In
  the process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents or that are
  root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take care
  to never drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.
+
* If after this parent rewriting, `C'` is a root or merge commit (has
  zero or >1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it remains.
  Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.
--
+
The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
`--full-history` with parent rewriting.  The example turns into:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  .-A---M---N---O
	 /     /       /
	I     B       D
	 \   /       /
	  `---------'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Note the major differences in `N`, `P`, and `Q` over `--full-history`:
+
--
* `N`'s parent list had `I` removed, because it is an ancestor of the
  other parent `M`.  Still, `N` remained because it is !TREESAME.
+
* `P`'s parent list similarly had `I` removed.  `P` was then
  removed completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.
+
* `Q`'s parent list had `Y` simplified to `X`. `X` was then removed, because it
  was a TREESAME root. `Q` was then removed completely, because it had one
  parent and is TREESAME.
--

Finally, there is a fifth simplification mode available:

--ancestry-path::
	Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the ancestry
	chain between the ``from'' and ``to'' commits in the given commit
	range. I.e. only display commits that are ancestor of the ``to''
	commit and descendants of the ``from'' commit.
+
As an example use case, consider the following commit history:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	    D---E-------F
	   /     \       \
	  B---C---G---H---I---J
	 /                     \
	A-------K---------------L--M
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
A regular 'D..M' computes the set of commits that are ancestors of `M`,
but excludes the ones that are ancestors of `D`. This is useful to see
what happened to the history leading to `M` since `D`, in the sense
that ``what does `M` have that did not exist in `D`''. The result in this
example would be all the commits, except `A` and `B` (and `D` itself,
of course).
+
When we want to find out what commits in `M` are contaminated with the
bug introduced by `D` and need fixing, however, we might want to view
only the subset of 'D..M' that are actually descendants of `D`, i.e.
excluding `C` and `K`. This is exactly what the `--ancestry-path`
option does. Applied to the 'D..M' range, it results in:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		E-------F
		 \       \
		  G---H---I---J
			       \
				L--M
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The `--simplify-by-decoration` option allows you to view only the
big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits
that are not referenced by tags.  Commits are marked as !TREESAME
(in other words, kept after history simplification rules described
above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they change the
contents of the paths given on the command line.  All other
commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away).

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
Bisection Helpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--bisect::
	Limit output to the one commit object which is roughly halfway between
	included and excluded commits. Note that the bad bisection ref
	`refs/bisect/bad` is added to the included commits (if it
	exists) and the good bisection refs `refs/bisect/good-*` are
	added to the excluded commits (if they exist). Thus, supposing there
	are no refs in `refs/bisect/`, if
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	$ git rev-list --bisect foo ^bar ^baz
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
outputs 'midpoint', the output of the two commands
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	$ git rev-list foo ^midpoint
	$ git rev-list midpoint ^bar ^baz
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
would be of roughly the same length.  Finding the change which
introduces a regression is thus reduced to a binary search: repeatedly
generate and test new 'midpoint's until the commit chain is of length
one. Cannot be combined with --first-parent.

--bisect-vars::
	This calculates the same as `--bisect`, except that refs in
	`refs/bisect/` are not used, and except that this outputs
	text ready to be eval'ed by the shell. These lines will assign the
	name of the midpoint revision to the variable `bisect_rev`, and the
	expected number of commits to be tested after `bisect_rev` is tested
	to `bisect_nr`, the expected number of commits to be tested if
	`bisect_rev` turns out to be good to `bisect_good`, the expected
	number of commits to be tested if `bisect_rev` turns out to be bad to
	`bisect_bad`, and the number of commits we are bisecting right now to
	`bisect_all`.

--bisect-all::
	This outputs all the commit objects between the included and excluded
	commits, ordered by their distance to the included and excluded
	commits. Refs in `refs/bisect/` are not used. The farthest
	from them is displayed first. (This is the only one displayed by
	`--bisect`.)
+
This is useful because it makes it easy to choose a good commit to
test when you want to avoid to test some of them for some reason (they
may not compile for example).
+
This option can be used along with `--bisect-vars`, in this case,
after all the sorted commit objects, there will be the same text as if
`--bisect-vars` had been used alone.

Commit Ordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order.

--date-order::
	Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
	otherwise show commits in the commit timestamp order.

--author-date-order::
	Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
	otherwise show commits in the author timestamp order.

--topo-order::
	Show no parents before all of its children are shown, and
	avoid showing commits on multiple lines of history
	intermixed.
+
For example, in a commit history like this:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------

    ---1----2----4----7
	\	       \
	 3----5----6----8---

----------------------------------------------------------------
+
where the numbers denote the order of commit timestamps, `git
rev-list` and friends with `--date-order` show the commits in the
timestamp order: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.
+
With `--topo-order`, they would show 8 6 5 3 7 4 2 1 (or 8 7 4 2 6 5
3 1); some older commits are shown before newer ones in order to
avoid showing the commits from two parallel development track mixed
together.

--reverse::
	Output the commits in reverse order.
	Cannot be combined with `--walk-reflogs`.

Object Traversal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options are mostly targeted for packing of Git repositories.

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
--objects::
	Print the object IDs of any object referenced by the listed
	commits.  `--objects foo ^bar` thus means ``send me
	all object IDs which I need to download if I have the commit
	object _bar_ but not _foo_''.

--objects-edge::
	Similar to `--objects`, but also print the IDs of excluded
	commits prefixed with a ``-'' character.  This is used by
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1] to build a ``thin'' pack, which records
	objects in deltified form based on objects contained in these
	excluded commits to reduce network traffic.

--objects-edge-aggressive::
	Similar to `--objects-edge`, but it tries harder to find excluded
	commits at the cost of increased time.  This is used instead of
	`--objects-edge` to build ``thin'' packs for shallow repositories.

--indexed-objects::
	Pretend as if all trees and blobs used by the index are listed
	on the command line.  Note that you probably want to use
	`--objects`, too.

--unpacked::
	Only useful with `--objects`; print the object IDs that are not
	in packs.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--no-walk[=(sorted|unsorted)]::
	Only show the given commits, but do not traverse their ancestors.
	This has no effect if a range is specified. If the argument
	`unsorted` is given, the commits are shown in the order they were
	given on the command line. Otherwise (if `sorted` or no argument
	was given), the commits are shown in reverse chronological order
	by commit time.
	Cannot be combined with `--graph`.

--do-walk::
	Overrides a previous `--no-walk`.

Commit Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
Using these options, linkgit:git-rev-list[1] will act similar to the
more specialized family of commit log tools: linkgit:git-log[1],
linkgit:git-show[1], and linkgit:git-whatchanged[1]
endif::git-rev-list[]

--pretty[=<format>]::
--format=<format>::

	Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format,
	where '<format>' can be one of 'oneline', 'short', 'medium',
	'full', 'fuller', 'email', 'raw', 'format:<string>'
	and 'tformat:<string>'.  When '<format>' is none of the above,
	and has '%placeholder' in it, it acts as if
	'--pretty=tformat:<format>' were given.
+
See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details for each
format.  When '=<format>' part is omitted, it defaults to 'medium'.
+
Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
configuration (see linkgit:git-config[1]).

--abbrev-commit::
	Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object
	name, show only a partial prefix.  Non default number of
	digits can be specified with "--abbrev=<n>" (which also modifies
	diff output, if it is displayed).
+
This should make "--pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for
people using 80-column terminals.

--no-abbrev-commit::
	Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This negates
	`--abbrev-commit` and those options which imply it such as
	"--oneline". It also overrides the 'log.abbrevCommit' variable.

--oneline::
	This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit"
	used together.

--encoding=<encoding>::
	The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message
	in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the
	command to re-code the commit log message in the encoding
	preferred by the user.  For non plumbing commands this
	defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object claims to be encoded
	in `X` and we are outputting in `X`, we will output the object
	verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original
	commit may be copied to the output.

ifndef::git-rev-list[]
--notes[=<ref>]::
	Show the notes (see linkgit:git-notes[1]) that annotate the
	commit, when showing the commit log message.  This is the default
	for `git log`, `git show` and `git whatchanged` commands when
	there is no `--pretty`, `--format`, or `--oneline` option given
	on the command line.
+
By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
'core.notesRef' and 'notes.displayRef' variables (or corresponding
environment overrides). See linkgit:git-config[1] for more details.
+
With an optional '<ref>' argument, show this notes ref instead of the
default notes ref(s). The ref specifies the full refname when it begins
with `refs/notes/`; when it begins with `notes/`, `refs/` and otherwise
`refs/notes/` is prefixed to form a full name of the ref.
+
Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes are
being displayed. Examples: "--notes=foo" will show only notes from
"refs/notes/foo"; "--notes=foo --notes" will show both notes from
"refs/notes/foo" and from the default notes ref(s).

--no-notes::
	Do not show notes. This negates the above `--notes` option, by
	resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown.
	Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g.
	"--notes --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar" will only show notes
	from "refs/notes/bar".

--show-notes[=<ref>]::
--[no-]standard-notes::
	These options are deprecated. Use the above --notes/--no-notes
	options instead.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--show-signature::
	Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the signature
	to `gpg --verify` and show the output.


--relative-date::
	Synonym for `--date=relative`.

--date=(relative|local|default|iso|iso-strict|rfc|short|raw)::
	Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format, such
	as when using `--pretty`. `log.date` config variable sets a default
	value for the log command's `--date` option.
+
`--date=relative` shows dates relative to the current time,
e.g. ``2 hours ago''.
+
`--date=local` shows timestamps in user's local time zone.
+
`--date=iso` (or `--date=iso8601`) shows timestamps in a ISO 8601-like format.
The differences to the strict ISO 8601 format are:

	- a space instead of the `T` date/time delimiter
	- a space between time and time zone
	- no colon between hours and minutes of the time zone

+
`--date=iso-strict` (or `--date=iso8601-strict`) shows timestamps in strict
ISO 8601 format.
+
`--date=rfc` (or `--date=rfc2822`) shows timestamps in RFC 2822
format, often found in email messages.
+
`--date=short` shows only the date, but not the time, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
+
`--date=raw` shows the date in the internal raw Git format `%s %z` format.
+
`--date=format:...` feeds the format `...` to your system `strftime`.
Use `--date=format:%c` to show the date in your system locale's
preferred format.  See the `strftime` manual for a complete list of
format placeholders.
+
`--date=default` shows timestamps in the original time zone
(either committer's or author's).

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
--header::
	Print the contents of the commit in raw-format; each record is
	separated with a NUL character.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--parents::
	Print also the parents of the commit (in the form "commit parent...").
	Also enables parent rewriting, see 'History Simplification' below.

--children::
	Print also the children of the commit (in the form "commit child...").
	Also enables parent rewriting, see 'History Simplification' below.

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
--timestamp::
	Print the raw commit timestamp.
endif::git-rev-list[]

--left-right::
	Mark which side of a symmetric diff a commit is reachable from.
	Commits from the left side are prefixed with `<` and those from
	the right with `>`.  If combined with `--boundary`, those
	commits are prefixed with `-`.
+
For example, if you have this topology:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	     y---b---b  branch B
	    / \ /
	   /   .
	  /   / \
	 o---x---a---a  branch A
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
you would get an output like this:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	$ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B

	>bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
	>bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
	<aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
	<aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
	-yyyyyyy... 1st on b
	-xxxxxxx... 1st on a
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

--graph::
	Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history
	on the left hand side of the output.  This may cause extra lines
	to be printed in between commits, in order for the graph history
	to be drawn properly.
	Cannot be combined with `--no-walk`.
+
This enables parent rewriting, see 'History Simplification' below.
+
This implies the `--topo-order` option by default, but the
`--date-order` option may also be specified.

--show-linear-break[=<barrier>]::
	When --graph is not used, all history branches are flattened
	which can make it hard to see that the two consecutive commits
	do not belong to a linear branch. This option puts a barrier
	in between them in that case. If `<barrier>` is specified, it
	is the string that will be shown instead of the default one.

ifdef::git-rev-list[]
--count::
	Print a number stating how many commits would have been
	listed, and suppress all other output.  When used together
	with `--left-right`, instead print the counts for left and
	right commits, separated by a tab. When used together with
	`--cherry-mark`, omit patch equivalent commits from these
	counts and print the count for equivalent commits separated
	by a tab.
endif::git-rev-list[]

ifndef::git-rev-list[]
Diff Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Listed below are options that control the formatting of diff output.
Some of them are specific to linkgit:git-rev-list[1], however other diff
options may be given. See linkgit:git-diff-files[1] for more options.

-c::
	With this option, diff output for a merge commit
	shows the differences from each of the parents to the merge result
	simultaneously instead of showing pairwise diff between a parent
	and the result one at a time. Furthermore, it lists only files
	which were modified from all parents.

--cc::
	This flag implies the `-c` option and further compresses the
	patch output by omitting uninteresting hunks whose contents in
	the parents have only two variants and the merge result picks
	one of them without modification.

-m::
	This flag makes the merge commits show the full diff like
	regular commits; for each merge parent, a separate log entry
	and diff is generated. An exception is that only diff against
	the first parent is shown when `--first-parent` option is given;
	in that case, the output represents the changes the merge
	brought _into_ the then-current branch.

-r::
	Show recursive diffs.

-t::
	Show the tree objects in the diff output. This implies `-r`.
endif::git-rev-list[]


PRETTY FORMATS
--------------

If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format
is not 'oneline', 'email' or 'raw', an additional line is
inserted before the 'Author:' line.  This line begins with
"Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed,
separated by spaces.  Note that the listed commits may not
necessarily be the list of the *direct* parent commits if you
have limited your view of history: for example, if you are
only interested in changes related to a certain directory or
file.

There are several built-in formats, and you can define
additional formats by setting a pretty.<name>
config option to either another format name, or a
'format:' string, as described below (see
linkgit:git-config[1]). Here are the details of the
built-in formats:

* 'oneline'

	  <sha1> <title line>
+
This is designed to be as compact as possible.

* 'short'

	  commit <sha1>
	  Author: <author>

	      <title line>

* 'medium'

	  commit <sha1>
	  Author: <author>
	  Date:   <author date>

	      <title line>

	      <full commit message>

* 'full'

	  commit <sha1>
	  Author: <author>
	  Commit: <committer>

	      <title line>

	      <full commit message>

* 'fuller'

	  commit <sha1>
	  Author:     <author>
	  AuthorDate: <author date>
	  Commit:     <committer>
	  CommitDate: <committer date>

	       <title line>

	       <full commit message>

* 'email'

	  From <sha1> <date>
	  From: <author>
	  Date: <author date>
	  Subject: [PATCH] <title line>

	  <full commit message>

* 'raw'
+
The 'raw' format shows the entire commit exactly as
stored in the commit object.  Notably, the SHA-1s are
displayed in full, regardless of whether --abbrev or
--no-abbrev are used, and 'parents' information show the
true parent commits, without taking grafts or history
simplification into account. Note that this format affects the way
commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e.g. with
`git log --raw`. To get full object names in a raw diff format,
use `--no-abbrev`.

* 'format:<string>'
+
The 'format:<string>' format allows you to specify which information
you want to show. It works a little bit like printf format,
with the notable exception that you get a newline with '%n'
instead of '\n'.
+
E.g, 'format:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"'
would show something like this:
+
-------
The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was >>t4119: test autocomputing -p<n> for traditional diff input.<<

-------
+
The placeholders are:

- '%H': commit hash
- '%h': abbreviated commit hash
- '%T': tree hash
- '%t': abbreviated tree hash
- '%P': parent hashes
- '%p': abbreviated parent hashes
- '%an': author name
- '%aN': author name (respecting .mailmap, see linkgit:git-shortlog[1]
  or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%ae': author email
- '%aE': author email (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%ad': author date (format respects --date= option)
- '%aD': author date, RFC2822 style
- '%ar': author date, relative
- '%at': author date, UNIX timestamp
- '%ai': author date, ISO 8601-like format
- '%aI': author date, strict ISO 8601 format
- '%cn': committer name
- '%cN': committer name (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%ce': committer email
- '%cE': committer email (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%cd': committer date (format respects --date= option)
- '%cD': committer date, RFC2822 style
- '%cr': committer date, relative
- '%ct': committer date, UNIX timestamp
- '%ci': committer date, ISO 8601-like format
- '%cI': committer date, strict ISO 8601 format
- '%d': ref names, like the --decorate option of linkgit:git-log[1]
- '%D': ref names without the " (", ")" wrapping.
- '%e': encoding
- '%s': subject
- '%f': sanitized subject line, suitable for a filename
- '%b': body
- '%B': raw body (unwrapped subject and body)
ifndef::git-rev-list[]
- '%N': commit notes
endif::git-rev-list[]
- '%GG': raw verification message from GPG for a signed commit
- '%G?': show "G" for a Good signature, "B" for a Bad signature, "U" for a good,
  untrusted signature and "N" for no signature
- '%GS': show the name of the signer for a signed commit
- '%GK': show the key used to sign a signed commit
- '%gD': reflog selector, e.g., `refs/stash@{1}`
- '%gd': shortened reflog selector, e.g., `stash@{1}`
- '%gn': reflog identity name
- '%gN': reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%ge': reflog identity email
- '%gE': reflog identity email (respecting .mailmap, see
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1] or linkgit:git-blame[1])
- '%gs': reflog subject
- '%Cred': switch color to red
- '%Cgreen': switch color to green
- '%Cblue': switch color to blue
- '%Creset': reset color
- '%C(...)': color specification, as described in color.branch.* config option;
  adding `auto,` at the beginning will emit color only when colors are
  enabled for log output (by `color.diff`, `color.ui`, or `--color`, and
  respecting the `auto` settings of the former if we are going to a
  terminal). `auto` alone (i.e. `%C(auto)`) will turn on auto coloring
  on the next placeholders until the color is switched again.
- '%m': left, right or boundary mark
- '%n': newline
- '%%': a raw '%'
- '%x00': print a byte from a hex code
- '%w([<w>[,<i1>[,<i2>]]])': switch line wrapping, like the -w option of
  linkgit:git-shortlog[1].
- '%<(<N>[,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc])': make the next placeholder take at
  least N columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary.
  Optionally truncate at the beginning (ltrunc), the middle (mtrunc)
  or the end (trunc) if the output is longer than N columns.
  Note that truncating only works correctly with N >= 2.
- '%<|(<N>)': make the next placeholder take at least until Nth
  columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary
- '%>(<N>)', '%>|(<N>)': similar to '%<(<N>)', '%<|(<N>)'
  respectively, but padding spaces on the left
- '%>>(<N>)', '%>>|(<N>)': similar to '%>(<N>)', '%>|(<N>)'
  respectively, except that if the next placeholder takes more spaces
  than given and there are spaces on its left, use those spaces
- '%><(<N>)', '%><|(<N>)': similar to '% <(<N>)', '%<|(<N>)'
  respectively, but padding both sides (i.e. the text is centered)

NOTE: Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the
revision traversal engine. For example, the `%g*` reflog options will
insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by
`git log -g`). The `%d` and `%D` placeholders will use the "short"
decoration format if `--decorate` was not already provided on the command
line.

If you add a `+` (plus sign) after '%' of a placeholder, a line-feed
is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

If you add a `-` (minus sign) after '%' of a placeholder, line-feeds that
immediately precede the expansion are deleted if and only if the
placeholder expands to an empty string.

If you add a ` ` (space) after '%' of a placeholder, a space
is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

* 'tformat:'
+
The 'tformat:' format works exactly like 'format:', except that it
provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics. In
other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a
newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries.
This means that the final entry of a single-line format will be properly
terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does.
For example:
+
---------------------
$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973
---------------------
+
In addition, any unrecognized string that has a `%` in it is interpreted
as if it has `tformat:` in front of it.  For example, these two are
equivalent:
+
---------------------
$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
$ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef
---------------------

:git-diff-core: 1
endif::git-log[]
endif::git-diff[]
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifdef::git-format-patch[]
-p::
--no-stat::
	Generate plain patches without any diffstats.
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
-p::
-u::
--patch::
	Generate patch (see section on generating patches).
ifdef::git-diff[]
	This is the default.
endif::git-diff[]
endif::git-format-patch[]

-s::
--no-patch::
	Suppress diff output. Useful for commands like `git show` that
	show the patch by default, or to cancel the effect of `--patch`.

-U<n>::
--unified=<n>::
	Generate diffs with <n> lines of context instead of
	the usual three.
ifndef::git-format-patch[]
	Implies `-p`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--raw::
ifndef::git-log[]
	Generate the diff in raw format.
ifdef::git-diff-core[]
	This is the default.
endif::git-diff-core[]
endif::git-log[]
ifdef::git-log[]
	For each commit, show a summary of changes using the raw diff
	format. See the "RAW OUTPUT FORMAT" section of
	linkgit:git-diff[1]. This is different from showing the log
	itself in raw format, which you can achieve with
	`--format=raw`.
endif::git-log[]
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--patch-with-raw::
	Synonym for `-p --raw`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--minimal::
	Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible
	diff is produced.

--patience::
	Generate a diff using the "patience diff" algorithm.

--histogram::
	Generate a diff using the "histogram diff" algorithm.

--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}::
	Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:
+
--
`default`, `myers`;;
	The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the default.
`minimal`;;
	Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
	produced.
`patience`;;
	Use "patience diff" algorithm when generating patches.
`histogram`;;
	This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to "support
	low-occurrence common elements".
--
+
For instance, if you configured diff.algorithm variable to a
non-default value and want to use the default one, then you
have to use `--diff-algorithm=default` option.

--stat[=<width>[,<name-width>[,<count>]]]::
	Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary
	will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph
	part. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns
	if not connected to a terminal, and can be overridden by
	`<width>`. The width of the filename part can be limited by
	giving another width `<name-width>` after a comma. The width
	of the graph part can be limited by using
	`--stat-graph-width=<width>` (affects all commands generating
	a stat graph) or by setting `diff.statGraphWidth=<width>`
	(does not affect `git format-patch`).
	By giving a third parameter `<count>`, you can limit the
	output to the first `<count>` lines, followed by `...` if
	there are more.
+
These parameters can also be set individually with `--stat-width=<width>`,
`--stat-name-width=<name-width>` and `--stat-count=<count>`.

--numstat::
	Similar to `--stat`, but shows number of added and
	deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without
	abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly.  For
	binary files, outputs two `-` instead of saying
	`0 0`.

--shortstat::
	Output only the last line of the `--stat` format containing total
	number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted
	lines.

--dirstat[=<param1,param2,...>]::
	Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each
	sub-directory. The behavior of `--dirstat` can be customized by
	passing it a comma separated list of parameters.
	The defaults are controlled by the `diff.dirstat` configuration
	variable (see linkgit:git-config[1]).
	The following parameters are available:
+
--
`changes`;;
	Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been
	removed from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores
	the amount of pure code movements within a file.  In other words,
	rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes.
	This is the default behavior when no parameter is given.
`lines`;;
	Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
	analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary
	files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no
	natural concept of lines). This is a more expensive `--dirstat`
	behavior than the `changes` behavior, but it does count rearranged
	lines within a file as much as other changes. The resulting output
	is consistent with what you get from the other `--*stat` options.
`files`;;
	Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed.
	Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is
	the computationally cheapest `--dirstat` behavior, since it does
	not have to look at the file contents at all.
`cumulative`;;
	Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well.
	Note that when using `cumulative`, the sum of the percentages
	reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can
	be specified with the `noncumulative` parameter.
<limit>;;
	An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
	Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes
	are not shown in the output.
--
+
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files,
and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
`--dirstat=files,10,cumulative`.

--summary::
	Output a condensed summary of extended header information
	such as creations, renames and mode changes.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--patch-with-stat::
	Synonym for `-p --stat`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]

-z::
ifdef::git-log[]
	Separate the commits with NULs instead of with new newlines.
+
Also, when `--raw` or `--numstat` has been given, do not munge
pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.
endif::git-log[]
ifndef::git-log[]
	When `--raw`, `--numstat`, `--name-only` or `--name-status` has been
	given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.
endif::git-log[]
+
Without this option, each pathname output will have TAB, LF, double quotes,
and backslash characters replaced with `\t`, `\n`, `\"`, and `\\`,
respectively, and the pathname will be enclosed in double quotes if
any of those replacements occurred.

--name-only::
	Show only names of changed files.

--name-status::
	Show only names and status of changed files. See the description
	of the `--diff-filter` option on what the status letters mean.

--submodule[=<format>]::
	Specify how differences in submodules are shown.  When `--submodule`
	or `--submodule=log` is given, the 'log' format is used.  This format lists
	the commits in the range like linkgit:git-submodule[1] `summary` does.
	Omitting the `--submodule` option or specifying `--submodule=short`,
	uses the 'short' format. This format just shows the names of the commits
	at the beginning and end of the range.  Can be tweaked via the
	`diff.submodule` configuration variable.

--color[=<when>]::
	Show colored diff.
	`--color` (i.e. without '=<when>') is the same as `--color=always`.
	'<when>' can be one of `always`, `never`, or `auto`.
ifdef::git-diff[]
	It can be changed by the `color.ui` and `color.diff`
	configuration settings.
endif::git-diff[]

--no-color::
	Turn off colored diff.
ifdef::git-diff[]
	This can be used to override configuration settings.
endif::git-diff[]
	It is the same as `--color=never`.

--word-diff[=<mode>]::
	Show a word diff, using the <mode> to delimit changed words.
	By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
	`--word-diff-regex` below.  The <mode> defaults to 'plain', and
	must be one of:
+
--
color::
	Highlight changed words using only colors.  Implies `--color`.
plain::
	Show words as `[-removed-]` and `{+added+}`.  Makes no
	attempts to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input,
	so the output may be ambiguous.
porcelain::
	Use a special line-based format intended for script
	consumption.  Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the
	usual unified diff format, starting with a `+`/`-`/` `
	character at the beginning of the line and extending to the
	end of the line.  Newlines in the input are represented by a
	tilde `~` on a line of its own.
none::
	Disable word diff again.
--
+
Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to
highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled.

--word-diff-regex=<regex>::
	Use <regex> to decide what a word is, instead of considering
	runs of non-whitespace to be a word.  Also implies
	`--word-diff` unless it was already enabled.
+
Every non-overlapping match of the
<regex> is considered a word.  Anything between these matches is
considered whitespace and ignored(!) for the purposes of finding
differences.  You may want to append `|[^[:space:]]` to your regular
expression to make sure that it matches all non-whitespace characters.
A match that contains a newline is silently truncated(!) at the
newline.
+
For example, `--word-diff-regex=.` will treat each character as a word
and, correspondingly, show differences character by character.
+
The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration option, see
linkgit:gitattributes[1] or linkgit:git-config[1].  Giving it explicitly
overrides any diff driver or configuration setting.  Diff drivers
override configuration settings.

--color-words[=<regex>]::
	Equivalent to `--word-diff=color` plus (if a regex was
	specified) `--word-diff-regex=<regex>`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--no-renames::
	Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration
	file gives the default to do so.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--check::
	Warn if changes introduce whitespace errors.  What are
	considered whitespace errors is controlled by `core.whitespace`
	configuration.  By default, trailing whitespaces (including
	lines that solely consist of whitespaces) and a space character
	that is immediately followed by a tab character inside the
	initial indent of the line are considered whitespace errors.
	Exits with non-zero status if problems are found. Not compatible
	with --exit-code.

--ws-error-highlight=<kind>::
	Highlight whitespace errors on lines specified by <kind>
	in the color specified by `color.diff.whitespace`.  <kind>
	is a comma separated list of `old`, `new`, `context`.  When
	this option is not given, only whitespace errors in `new`
	lines are highlighted.  E.g. `--ws-error-highlight=new,old`
	highlights whitespace errors on both deleted and added lines.
	`all` can be used as a short-hand for `old,new,context`.

endif::git-format-patch[]

--full-index::
	Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
	pre- and post-image blob object names on the "index"
	line when generating patch format output.

--binary::
	In addition to `--full-index`, output a binary diff that
	can be applied with `git-apply`.

--abbrev[=<n>]::
	Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object
	name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header
	lines, show only a partial prefix.  This is
	independent of the `--full-index` option above, which controls
	the diff-patch output format.  Non default number of
	digits can be specified with `--abbrev=<n>`.

-B[<n>][/<m>]::
--break-rewrites[=[<n>][/<m>]]::
	Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
	create. This serves two purposes:
+
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file
not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very
few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a
single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of
everything new, and the number `m` controls this aspect of the -B
option (defaults to 60%). `-B/70%` specifies that less than 30% of the
original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total
rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of
deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines).
+
When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the
source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared
as the source of a rename), and the number `n` controls this aspect of
the -B option (defaults to 50%). `-B20%` specifies that a change with
addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file's size are
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to
another file.

-M[<n>]::
--find-renames[=<n>]::
ifndef::git-log[]
	Detect renames.
endif::git-log[]
ifdef::git-log[]
	If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit.
	For following files across renames while traversing history, see
	`--follow`.
endif::git-log[]
	If `n` is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
	index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the
	file's size). For example, `-M90%` means Git should consider a
	delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file
	hasn't changed.  Without a `%` sign, the number is to be read as
	a fraction, with a decimal point before it.  I.e., `-M5` becomes
	0.5, and is thus the same as `-M50%`.  Similarly, `-M05` is
	the same as `-M5%`.  To limit detection to exact renames, use
	`-M100%`.  The default similarity index is 50%.

-C[<n>]::
--find-copies[=<n>]::
	Detect copies as well as renames.  See also `--find-copies-harder`.
	If `n` is specified, it has the same meaning as for `-M<n>`.

--find-copies-harder::
	For performance reasons, by default, `-C` option finds copies only
	if the original file of the copy was modified in the same
	changeset.  This flag makes the command
	inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of
	copy.  This is a very expensive operation for large
	projects, so use it with caution.  Giving more than one
	`-C` option has the same effect.

-D::
--irreversible-delete::
	Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not
	the diff between the preimage and `/dev/null`. The resulting patch
	is not meant to be applied with `patch` or `git apply`; this is
	solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the
	text after the change. In addition, the output obviously lack
	enough information to apply such a patch in reverse, even manually,
	hence the name of the option.
+
When used together with `-B`, omit also the preimage in the deletion part
of a delete/create pair.

-l<num>::
	The `-M` and `-C` options require O(n^2) processing time where n
	is the number of potential rename/copy targets.  This
	option prevents rename/copy detection from running if
	the number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified
	number.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]::
	Select only files that are Added (`A`), Copied (`C`),
	Deleted (`D`), Modified (`M`), Renamed (`R`), have their
	type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (`T`),
	are Unmerged (`U`), are
	Unknown (`X`), or have had their pairing Broken (`B`).
	Any combination of the filter characters (including none) can be used.
	When `*` (All-or-none) is added to the combination, all
	paths are selected if there is any file that matches
	other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file
	that matches other criteria, nothing is selected.

-S<string>::
	Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of
	the specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file.
	Intended for the scripter's use.
+
It is useful when you're looking for an exact block of code (like a
struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first
came into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting
block in the preimage back into `-S`, and keep going until you get the
very first version of the block.

-G<regex>::
	Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed
	lines that match <regex>.
+
To illustrate the difference between `-S<regex> --pickaxe-regex` and
`-G<regex>`, consider a commit with the following diff in the same
file:
+
----
+    return !regexec(regexp, two->ptr, 1, &regmatch, 0);
...
-    hit = !regexec(regexp, mf2.ptr, 1, &regmatch, 0);
----
+
While `git log -G"regexec\(regexp"` will show this commit, `git log
-S"regexec\(regexp" --pickaxe-regex` will not (because the number of
occurrences of that string did not change).
+
See the 'pickaxe' entry in linkgit:gitdiffcore[7] for more
information.

--pickaxe-all::
	When `-S` or `-G` finds a change, show all the changes in that
	changeset, not just the files that contain the change
	in <string>.

--pickaxe-regex::
	Treat the <string> given to `-S` as an extended POSIX regular
	expression to match.
endif::git-format-patch[]

-O<orderfile>::
	Output the patch in the order specified in the
	<orderfile>, which has one shell glob pattern per line.
	This overrides the `diff.orderFile` configuration variable
	(see linkgit:git-config[1]).  To cancel `diff.orderFile`,
	use `-O/dev/null`.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
-R::
	Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or
	on-disk file to tree contents.

--relative[=<path>]::
	When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be
	told to exclude changes outside the directory and show
	pathnames relative to it with this option.  When you are
	not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare repository), you
	can name which subdirectory to make the output relative
	to by giving a <path> as an argument.
endif::git-format-patch[]

-a::
--text::
	Treat all files as text.

--ignore-space-at-eol::
	Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.

-b::
--ignore-space-change::
	Ignore changes in amount of whitespace.  This ignores whitespace
	at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or
	more whitespace characters to be equivalent.

-w::
--ignore-all-space::
	Ignore whitespace when comparing lines.  This ignores
	differences even if one line has whitespace where the other
	line has none.

--ignore-blank-lines::
	Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.

--inter-hunk-context=<lines>::
	Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number
	of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other.

-W::
--function-context::
	Show whole surrounding functions of changes.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
ifndef::git-log[]
--exit-code::
	Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1).
	That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and
	0 means no differences.

--quiet::
	Disable all output of the program. Implies `--exit-code`.
endif::git-log[]
endif::git-format-patch[]

--ext-diff::
	Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an
	external diff driver with linkgit:gitattributes[5], you need
	to use this option with linkgit:git-log[1] and friends.

--no-ext-diff::
	Disallow external diff drivers.

--textconv::
--no-textconv::
	Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be run
	when comparing binary files. See linkgit:gitattributes[5] for
	details. Because textconv filters are typically a one-way
	conversion, the resulting diff is suitable for human
	consumption, but cannot be applied. For this reason, textconv
	filters are enabled by default only for linkgit:git-diff[1] and
	linkgit:git-log[1], but not for linkgit:git-format-patch[1] or
	diff plumbing commands.

--ignore-submodules[=<when>]::
	Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation. <when> can be
	either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the default.
	Using "none" will consider the submodule modified when it either contains
	untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded
	in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the
	'ignore' option in linkgit:git-config[1] or linkgit:gitmodules[5]. When
	"untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only
	contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
	content). Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules,
	only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was
	the behavior until 1.7.0). Using "all" hides all changes to submodules.

--src-prefix=<prefix>::
	Show the given source prefix instead of "a/".

--dst-prefix=<prefix>::
	Show the given destination prefix instead of "b/".

--no-prefix::
	Do not show any source or destination prefix.

For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also
linkgit:gitdiffcore[7].


Generating patches with -p
--------------------------

When "git-diff-index", "git-diff-tree", or "git-diff-files" are run
with a '-p' option, "git diff" without the '--raw' option, or
"git log" with the "-p" option, they
do not produce the output described above; instead they produce a
patch file.  You can customize the creation of such patches via the
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment variables.

What the -p option produces is slightly different from the traditional
diff format:

1.   It is preceded with a "git diff" header that looks like this:

       diff --git a/file1 b/file2
+
The `a/` and `b/` filenames are the same unless rename/copy is
involved.  Especially, even for a creation or a deletion,
`/dev/null` is _not_ used in place of the `a/` or `b/` filenames.
+
When rename/copy is involved, `file1` and `file2` show the
name of the source file of the rename/copy and the name of
the file that rename/copy produces, respectively.

2.   It is followed by one or more extended header lines:

       old mode <mode>
       new mode <mode>
       deleted file mode <mode>
       new file mode <mode>
       copy from <path>
       copy to <path>
       rename from <path>
       rename to <path>
       similarity index <number>
       dissimilarity index <number>
       index <hash>..<hash> <mode>
+
File modes are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file type
and file permission bits.
+
Path names in extended headers do not include the `a/` and `b/` prefixes.
+
The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and
the dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines.  It
is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign.  The
similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal
files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line from the old
file made it into the new one.
+
The index line includes the SHA-1 checksum before and after the change.
The <mode> is included if the file mode does not change; otherwise,
separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.

3.  TAB, LF, double quote and backslash characters in pathnames
    are represented as `\t`, `\n`, `\"` and `\\`, respectively.
    If there is need for such substitution then the whole
    pathname is put in double quotes.

4.  All the `file1` files in the output refer to files before the
    commit, and all the `file2` files refer to files after the commit.
    It is incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially.  For
    example, this patch will swap a and b:

      diff --git a/a b/b
      rename from a
      rename to b
      diff --git a/b b/a
      rename from b
      rename to a


combined diff format
--------------------

Any diff-generating command can take the `-c` or `--cc` option to
produce a 'combined diff' when showing a merge. This is the default
format when showing merges with linkgit:git-diff[1] or
linkgit:git-show[1]. Note also that you can give the `-m` option to any
of these commands to force generation of diffs with individual parents
of a merge.

A 'combined diff' format looks like this:

------------
diff --combined describe.c
index fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510
--- a/describe.c
+++ b/describe.c
@@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@
	return (a_date > b_date) ? -1 : (a_date == b_date) ? 0 : 1;
  }

- static void describe(char *arg)
 -static void describe(struct commit *cmit, int last_one)
++static void describe(char *arg, int last_one)
  {
 +	unsigned char sha1[20];
 +	struct commit *cmit;
	struct commit_list *list;
	static int initialized = 0;
	struct commit_name *n;

 +	if (get_sha1(arg, sha1) < 0)
 +		usage(describe_usage);
 +	cmit = lookup_commit_reference(sha1);
 +	if (!cmit)
 +		usage(describe_usage);
 +
	if (!initialized) {
		initialized = 1;
		for_each_ref(get_name);
------------

1.   It is preceded with a "git diff" header, that looks like
     this (when '-c' option is used):

       diff --combined file
+
or like this (when '--cc' option is used):

       diff --cc file

2.   It is followed by one or more extended header lines
     (this example shows a merge with two parents):

       index <hash>,<hash>..<hash>
       mode <mode>,<mode>..<mode>
       new file mode <mode>
       deleted file mode <mode>,<mode>
+
The `mode <mode>,<mode>..<mode>` line appears only if at least one of
the <mode> is different from the rest. Extended headers with
information about detected contents movement (renames and
copying detection) are designed to work with diff of two
<tree-ish> and are not used by combined diff format.

3.   It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file header

       --- a/file
       +++ b/file
+
Similar to two-line header for traditional 'unified' diff
format, `/dev/null` is used to signal created or deleted
files.

4.   Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from
     accidentally feeding it to `patch -p1`. Combined diff format
     was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not
     meant for apply. The change is similar to the change in the
     extended 'index' header:

       @@@ <from-file-range> <from-file-range> <to-file-range> @@@
+
There are (number of parents + 1) `@` characters in the chunk
header for combined diff format.

Unlike the traditional 'unified' diff format, which shows two
files A and B with a single column that has `-` (minus --
appears in A but removed in B), `+` (plus -- missing in A but
added to B), or `" "` (space -- unchanged) prefix, this format
compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one file X, and
shows how X differs from each of fileN.  One column for each of
fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X's line is
different from it.

A `-` character in the column N means that the line appears in
fileN but it does not appear in the result.  A `+` character
in the column N means that the line appears in the result,
and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was
added, from the point of view of that parent).

In the above example output, the function signature was changed
from both files (hence two `-` removals from both file1 and
file2, plus `++` to mean one line that was added does not appear
in either file1 or file2).  Also eight other lines are the same
from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with `+`).

When shown by `git diff-tree -c`, it compares the parents of a
merge commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the
parents).  When shown by `git diff-files -c`, it compares the
two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file
(i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka
"their version").


EXAMPLES
--------
`git log --no-merges`::

	Show the whole commit history, but skip any merges

`git log v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi`::

	Show all commits since version 'v2.6.12' that changed any file
	in the `include/scsi` or `drivers/scsi` subdirectories

`git log --since="2 weeks ago" -- gitk`::

	Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file 'gitk'.
	The ``--'' is necessary to avoid confusion with the *branch* named
	'gitk'

`git log --name-status release..test`::

	Show the commits that are in the "test" branch but not yet
	in the "release" branch, along with the list of paths
	each commit modifies.

`git log --follow builtin/rev-list.c`::

	Shows the commits that changed `builtin/rev-list.c`, including
	those commits that occurred before the file was given its
	present name.

`git log --branches --not --remotes=origin`::

	Shows all commits that are in any of local branches but not in
	any of remote-tracking branches for 'origin' (what you have that
	origin doesn't).

`git log master --not --remotes=*/master`::

	Shows all commits that are in local master but not in any remote
	repository master branches.

`git log -p -m --first-parent`::

	Shows the history including change diffs, but only from the
	``main branch'' perspective, skipping commits that come from merged
	branches, and showing full diffs of changes introduced by the merges.
	This makes sense only when following a strict policy of merging all
	topic branches when staying on a single integration branch.

`git log -L '/int main/',/^}/:main.c`::

	Shows how the function `main()` in the file `main.c` evolved
	over time.

`git log -3`::

	Limits the number of commits to show to 3.

DISCUSSION
----------

Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.

 - The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences
   of bytes.  There is no encoding translation at the core
   level.

 - Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This
   applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as
   path names in command line arguments, environment variables
   and config files (`.git/config` (see linkgit:git-config[1]),
   linkgit:gitignore[5], linkgit:gitattributes[5] and
   linkgit:gitmodules[5]).
+
Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as
sequences of non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding
conversions (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using
non-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file
systems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings. However,
repositories created on such systems will not work properly on
UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa.
Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to
be UTF-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly.

 - Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other
   extended ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes
   ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but _not_ UTF-16/32,
   EBCDIC and CJK multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5,
   EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).

Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded
in UTF-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to
force UTF-8 on projects.  If all participants of a particular
project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git
does not forbid it.  However, there are a few things to keep in
mind.

  a warning if the commit log message given to it does not look
  like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you explicitly say your
  project uses a legacy encoding.  The way to say this is to
  have i18n.commitencoding in `.git/config` file, like this:
+
------------
[i18n]
	commitencoding = ISO-8859-1
------------
+
Commit objects created with the above setting record the value
of `i18n.commitencoding` in its `encoding` header.  This is to
help other people who look at them later.  Lack of this header
implies that the commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.

. 'git log', 'git show', 'git blame' and friends look at the
  `encoding` header of a commit object, and try to re-code the
  log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified.  You can
  specify the desired output encoding with
  `i18n.logoutputencoding` in `.git/config` file, like this:
+
------------
[i18n]
	logoutputencoding = ISO-8859-1
------------
+
If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
`i18n.commitencoding` is used instead.

Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log
message when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit
object level, because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a
reversible operation.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

See linkgit:git-config[1] for core variables and linkgit:git-diff[1]
for settings related to diff generation.

format.pretty::
	Default for the `--format` option.  (See 'Pretty Formats' above.)
	Defaults to `medium`.

i18n.logOutputEncoding::
	Encoding to use when displaying logs.  (See 'Discussion' above.)
	Defaults to the value of `i18n.commitEncoding` if set, and UTF-8
	otherwise.

log.date::
	Default format for human-readable dates.  (Compare the
	`--date` option.)  Defaults to "default", which means to write
	dates like `Sat May 8 19:35:34 2010 -0500`.

log.follow::
	If `true`, `git log` will act as if the `--follow` option was used when
	a single <path> is given.  This has the same limitations as `--follow`,
	i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work well
	on non-linear history.

log.showRoot::
	If `false`, `git log` and related commands will not treat the
	initial commit as a big creation event.  Any root commits in
	`git log -p` output would be shown without a diff attached.
	The default is `true`.

mailmap.*::
	See linkgit:git-shortlog[1].

notes.displayRef::
	Which refs, in addition to the default set by `core.notesRef`
	or 'GIT_NOTES_REF', to read notes from when showing commit
	messages with the `log` family of commands.  See
	linkgit:git-notes[1].
+
May be an unabbreviated ref name or a glob and may be specified
multiple times.  A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist,
but a glob that does not match any refs is silently ignored.
+
This setting can be disabled by the `--no-notes` option,
overridden by the 'GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF' environment variable,
and overridden by the `--notes=<ref>` option.
