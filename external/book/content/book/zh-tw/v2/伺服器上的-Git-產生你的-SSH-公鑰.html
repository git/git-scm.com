<h2 id="r_generate_ssh_key">產生你的 SSH 公鑰</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
That being said, many Git servers authenticate using SSH public keys.
In order to provide a public key, each user in your system must generate one if they don’t already have one.
This process is similar across all operating systems.
First, you should check to make sure you don’t already have a key.
By default, a user’s SSH keys are stored in that user’s <code>~/.ssh</code> directory.
You can easily check to see if you have a key already by going to that directory and listing the contents:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
authorized_keys2  id_dsa       known_hosts
config            id_dsa.pub</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’re looking for a pair of files named something like <code>id_dsa</code> or <code>id_rsa</code> and a matching file with a <code>.pub</code> extension.
The <code>.pub</code> file is your public key, and the other file is your private key.
If you don’t have these files (or you don’t even have a <code>.ssh</code> directory), you can create them by running a program called <code>ssh-keygen</code>, which is provided with the SSH package on Linux/Mac systems and comes with Git for Windows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/schacon/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
d0:82:24:8e:d7:f1:bb:9b:33:53:96:93:49:da:9b:e3 schacon@mylaptop.local</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First it confirms where you want to save the key (<code>.ssh/id_rsa</code>), and then it asks twice for a passphrase, which you can leave empty if you don’t want to type a password when you use the key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, each user that does this has to send their public key to you or whoever is administrating the Git server (assuming you’re using an SSH server setup that requires public keys).
All they have to do is copy the contents of the <code>.pub</code> file and email it.
The public keys look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
