<h2 id="_patching">Patching</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few commands in Git are centered around the concept of thinking of commits in terms of the changes they introduce, as though the commit series is a series of patches.
These commands help you manage your branches in this manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_cherry_pick">git cherry-pick</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git cherry-pick</code> command is used to take the change introduced in a single Git commit and try to re-introduce it as a new commit on the branch you’re currently on.
This can be useful to only take one or two commits from a branch individually rather than merging in the branch which takes all the changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cherry picking is described and demonstrated in <a href="{{< relurl "book/sv/v2/ch00/_rebase_cherry_pick" >}}">Arbetsflöden med ombasering och plocka russin ur kakan</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_rebase">git rebase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git rebase</code> command is basically an automated <code>cherry-pick</code>.
It determines a series of commits and then cherry-picks them one by one in the same order somewhere else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rebasing is covered in detail in <a href="{{< relurl "book/sv/v2/ch00/_rebasing" >}}">Grenflytt</a>, including covering the collaborative issues involved with rebasing branches that are already public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use it in practice during an example of splitting your history into two separate repositories in <a href="{{< relurl "book/sv/v2/ch00/_replace" >}}">Replace</a>, using the <code>--onto</code> flag as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go through running into a merge conflict during rebasing in <a href="{{< relurl "book/sv/v2/ch00/ref_rerere" >}}">Rerere</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also use it in an interactive scripting mode with the <code>-i</code> option in <a href="{{< relurl "book/sv/v2/ch00/_changing_multiple" >}}">Changing Multiple Commit Messages</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_revert">git revert</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git revert</code> command is essentially a reverse <code>git cherry-pick</code>.
It creates a new commit that applies the exact opposite of the change introduced in the commit you’re targeting, essentially undoing or reverting it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use this in <a href="{{< relurl "book/sv/v2/ch00/_reverse_commit" >}}">Reverse the commit</a> to undo a merge commit.</p>
