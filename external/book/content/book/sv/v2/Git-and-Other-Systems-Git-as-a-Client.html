title: Git - Git as a Client
---
<p>The world isn’t perfect.
Usually, you can’t immediately switch every project you come in contact with to Git.
Sometimes you’re stuck on a project using another VCS, and wish it was Git.
We’ll spend the first part of this chapter learning about ways to use Git as a client when the project you’re working on is hosted in a different system.</p><p>At some point, you may want to convert your existing project to Git.
The second part of this chapter covers how to migrate your project into Git from several specific systems, as well as a method that will work if no pre-built import tool exists.</p>
<h2 id="_git_as_a_client">Git as a Client</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Git provides such a nice experience for developers that many people have figured out how to use it on their workstation, even if the rest of their team is using an entirely different VCS.
There are a number of these adapters, called “bridges,” available.
Here we’ll cover the ones you’re most likely to run into in the wild.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_svn">Git and Subversion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
A large fraction of open source development projects and a good number of corporate projects use Subversion to manage their source code.
It’s been around for more than a decade, and for most of that time was the <em>de facto</em> VCS choice for open-source projects.
It’s also very similar in many ways to CVS, which was the big boy of the source-control world before that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
One of Git’s great features is a bidirectional bridge to Subversion called <code>git svn</code>.
This tool allows you to use Git as a valid client to a Subversion server, so you can use all the local features of Git and then push to a Subversion server as if you were using Subversion locally.
This means you can do local branching and merging, use the staging area, use rebasing and cherry-picking, and so on, while your collaborators continue to work in their dark and ancient ways.
It’s a good way to sneak Git into the corporate environment and help your fellow developers become more efficient while you lobby to get the infrastructure changed to support Git fully.
The Subversion bridge is the gateway drug to the DVCS world.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_git_svn_2"><code>git svn</code></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The base command in Git for all the Subversion bridging commands is <code>git svn</code>.
It takes quite a few commands, so we’ll show the most common while going through a few simple workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s important to note that when you’re using <code>git svn</code>, you’re interacting with Subversion, which is a system that works very differently from Git.
Although you <strong>can</strong> do local branching and merging, it’s generally best to keep your history as linear as possible by rebasing your work, and avoiding doing things like simultaneously interacting with a Git remote repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don’t rewrite your history and try to push again, and don’t push to a parallel Git repository to collaborate with fellow Git developers at the same time.
Subversion can have only a single linear history, and confusing it is very easy.
If you’re working with a team, and some are using SVN and others are using Git, make sure everyone is using the SVN server to collaborate – doing so will make your life easier.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_setting_up">Setting Up</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To demonstrate this functionality, you need a typical SVN repository that you have write access to.
If you want to copy these examples, you’ll have to make a writeable copy of an SVN test repository.
In order to do that easily, you can use a tool called <code>svnsync</code> that comes with Subversion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To follow along, you first need to create a new local Subversion repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ mkdir /tmp/test-svn
$ svnadmin create /tmp/test-svn</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, enable all users to change revprops – the easy way is to add a <code>pre-revprop-change</code> script that always exits 0:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat /tmp/test-svn/hooks/pre-revprop-change
#!/bin/sh
exit 0;
$ chmod +x /tmp/test-svn/hooks/pre-revprop-change</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now sync this project to your local machine by calling <code>svnsync init</code> with the to and from repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ svnsync init file:///tmp/test-svn \
  http://your-svn-server.example.org/svn/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This sets up the properties to run the sync.
You can then clone the code by running</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ svnsync sync file:///tmp/test-svn
Committed revision 1.
Copied properties for revision 1.
Transmitting file data .............................[...]
Committed revision 2.
Copied properties for revision 2.
[…]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although this operation may take only a few minutes, if you try to copy the original repository to another remote repository instead of a local one, the process will take nearly an hour, even though there are fewer than 100 commits.
Subversion has to clone one revision at a time and then push it back into another repository – it’s ridiculously inefficient, but it’s the only easy way to do this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_getting_started">Getting Started</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have a Subversion repository to which you have write access, you can go through a typical workflow.
You’ll start with the <code>git svn clone</code> command, which imports an entire Subversion repository into a local Git repository.
Remember that if you’re importing from a real hosted Subversion repository, you should replace the <code>file:///tmp/test-svn</code> here with the URL of your Subversion repository:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This runs the equivalent of two commands – <code>git svn init</code> followed by <code>git svn fetch</code> – on the URL you provide.
This can take a while.
If, for example, the test project has only about 75 commits and the codebase isn’t that big, Git nevertheless must check out each version, one at a time, and commit it individually.
For a project with hundreds or thousands of commits, this can literally take hours or even days to finish.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>-T trunk -b branches -t tags</code> part tells Git that this Subversion repository follows the basic branching and tagging conventions.
If you name your trunk, branches, or tags differently, you can change these options.
Because this is so common, you can replace this entire part with <code>-s</code>, which means standard layout and implies all those options.
The following command is equivalent:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have a working directory, you can do some work on the project and push your commits back upstream, using Git effectively as an SVN client.
If you edit one of the files and commit it, you have a commit that exists in Git locally that doesn’t exist on the Subversion server:</p>

<p>Next, you need to push your change upstream.
Notice how this changes the way you work with Subversion – you can do several commits offline and then push them all at once to the Subversion server.
To push to a Subversion server, you run the <code>git svn dcommit</code> command:</p>

<p>When you’ve become comfortable with a Git workflow, you’ll likely create topic branches, do work on them, and then merge them in.
If you’re pushing to a Subversion server via <code>git svn</code>, you may want to rebase your work onto a single branch each time instead of merging branches together.
The reason to prefer rebasing is that Subversion has a linear history and doesn’t deal with merges like Git does, so <code>git svn</code> follows only the first parent when converting the snapshots into Subversion commits.</p>

<p>If you want to work on more than one branch simultaneously, you can set up local branches to <code>dcommit</code> to specific Subversion branches by starting them at the imported Subversion commit for that branch.
If you want an <code>opera</code> branch that you can work on separately, you can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch opera remotes/origin/opera</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if you want to merge your <code>opera</code> branch into <code>trunk</code> (your <code>master</code> branch), you can do so with a normal <code>git merge</code>.
But you need to provide a descriptive commit message (via <code>-m</code>), or the merge will say “Merge branch opera” instead of something useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that although you’re using <code>git merge</code> to do this operation, and the merge likely will be much easier than it would be in Subversion (because Git will automatically detect the appropriate merge base for you), this isn’t a normal Git merge commit.
You have to push this data back to a Subversion server that can’t handle a commit that tracks more than one parent; so, after you push it up, it will look like a single commit that squashed in all the work of another branch under a single commit.
After you merge one branch into another, you can’t easily go back and continue working on that branch, as you normally can in Git.
The <code>dcommit</code> command that you run erases any information that says what branch was merged in, so subsequent merge-base calculations will be wrong – the <code>dcommit</code> makes your <code>git merge</code> result look like you ran <code>git merge --squash</code>.
Unfortunately, there’s no good way to avoid this situation – Subversion can’t store this information, so you’ll always be crippled by its limitations while you’re using it as your server.
To avoid issues, you should delete the local branch (in this case, <code>opera</code>) after you merge it into trunk.</p>

<p>You should know two important things about <code>git svn log</code>.
First, it works offline, unlike the real <code>svn log</code> command, which asks the Subversion server for the data.
Second, it only shows you commits that have been committed up to the Subversion server.
Local Git commits that you haven’t dcommited don’t show up; neither do commits that people have made to the Subversion server in the meantime.
It’s more like the last known state of the commits on the Subversion server.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you clone a Subversion repository that has <code>svn:ignore</code> properties set anywhere, you’ll likely want to set corresponding <code>.gitignore</code> files so you don’t accidentally commit files that you shouldn’t.
<code>git svn</code> has two commands to help with this issue.
The first is <code>git svn create-ignore</code>, which automatically creates corresponding <code>.gitignore</code> files for you so your next commit can include them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second command is <code>git svn show-ignore</code>, which prints to stdout the lines you need to put in a <code>.gitignore</code> file so you can redirect the output into your project exclude file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git svn show-ignore &gt; .git/info/exclude</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That way, you don’t litter the project with <code>.gitignore</code> files.
This is a good option if you’re the only Git user on a Subversion team, and your teammates don’t want <code>.gitignore</code> files in the project.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_git_svn_summary">Git-Svn Summary</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git svn</code> tools are useful if you’re stuck with a Subversion server, or are otherwise in a development environment that necessitates running a Subversion server.
You should consider it crippled Git, however, or you’ll hit issues in translation that may confuse you and your collaborators.
To stay out of trouble, try to follow these guidelines:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep a linear Git history that doesn’t contain merge commits made by <code>git merge</code>.
Rebase any work you do outside of your mainline branch back onto it; don’t merge it in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t set up and collaborate on a separate Git server.
Possibly have one to speed up clones for new developers, but don’t push anything to it that doesn’t have a <code>git-svn-id</code> entry.
You may even want to add a <code>pre-receive</code> hook that checks each commit message for a <code>git-svn-id</code> and rejects pushes that contain commits without it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you follow those guidelines, working with a Subversion server can be more bearable.
However, if it’s possible to move to a real Git server, doing so can gain your team a lot more.</p>

<h3 id="_git_and_mercurial">Git and Mercurial</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

The DVCS universe is larger than just Git.
In fact, there are many other systems in this space, each with their own angle on how to do distributed version control correctly.
Apart from Git, the most popular is Mercurial, and the two are very similar in many respects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The good news, if you prefer Git’s client-side behavior but are working with a project whose source code is controlled with Mercurial, is that there’s a way to use Git as a client for a Mercurial-hosted repository.
Since the way Git talks to server repositories is through remotes, it should come as no surprise that this bridge is implemented as a remote helper.
The project’s name is git-remote-hg, and it can be found at <a href="https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg" class="bare">https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_git_remote_hg">git-remote-hg</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you need to install git-remote-hg.
This basically entails dropping its file somewhere in your path, like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ curl -o ~/bin/git-remote-hg \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipec/git-remote-hg/master/git-remote-hg
$ chmod +x ~/bin/git-remote-hg</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>…assuming <code>~/bin</code> is in your <code>$PATH</code>.
Git-remote-hg has one other dependency: the <code>mercurial</code> library for Python.
If you have Python installed, this is as simple as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ pip install mercurial</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(If you don’t have Python installed, visit <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="bare">https://www.python.org/</a> and get it first.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last thing you’ll need is the Mercurial client.
Go to <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" class="bare">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/</a> and install it if you haven’t already.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you’re ready to rock.
All you need is a Mercurial repository you can push to.
Fortunately, every Mercurial repository can act this way, so we’ll just use the "hello world" repository everyone uses to learn Mercurial:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ hg clone http://selenic.com/repo/hello /tmp/hello</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_getting_started_2">Getting Started</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have a suitable “server-side” repository, we can go through a typical workflow.
As you’ll see, these two systems are similar enough that there isn’t much friction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As always with Git, first we clone:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone hg::/tmp/hello /tmp/hello-git
$ cd /tmp/hello-git
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
* ac7955c (HEAD, origin/master, origin/branches/default, origin/HEAD, refs/hg/origin/branches/default, refs/hg/origin/bookmarks/master, master) Create a makefile
* 65bb417 Create a standard "hello, world" program</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll notice that working with a Mercurial repository uses the standard <code>git clone</code> command.
That’s because git-remote-hg is working at a fairly low level, using a similar mechanism to how Git’s HTTP/S protocol is implemented (remote helpers).
Since Git and Mercurial are both designed for every client to have a full copy of the repository history, this command makes a full clone, including all the project’s history, and does it fairly quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The log command shows two commits, the latest of which is pointed to by a whole slew of refs.
It turns out some of these aren’t actually there.
Let’s take a look at what’s actually in the <code>.git</code> directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ tree .git/refs
.git/refs
├── heads
│   └── master
├── hg
│   └── origin
│       ├── bookmarks
│       │   └── master
│       └── branches
│           └── default
├── notes
│   └── hg
├── remotes
│   └── origin
│       └── HEAD
└── tags

9 directories, 5 files</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-remote-hg is trying to make things more idiomatically Git-esque, but under the hood it’s managing the conceptual mapping between two slightly different systems.
The <code>refs/hg</code> directory is where the actual remote refs are stored.
For example, the <code>refs/hg/origin/branches/default</code> is a Git ref file that contains the SHA-1 starting with “ac7955c”, which is the commit that <code>master</code> points to.
So the <code>refs/hg</code> directory is kind of like a fake <code>refs/remotes/origin</code>, but it has the added distinction between bookmarks and branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>notes/hg</code> file is the starting point for how git-remote-hg maps Git commit hashes to Mercurial changeset IDs.
Let’s explore a bit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat notes/hg
d4c10386...

$ git cat-file -p d4c10386...
tree 1781c96...
author remote-hg &lt;&gt; 1408066400 -0800
committer remote-hg &lt;&gt; 1408066400 -0800

Notes for master

$ git ls-tree 1781c96...
100644 blob ac9117f...	65bb417...
100644 blob 485e178...	ac7955c...

$ git cat-file -p ac9117f
0a04b987be5ae354b710cefeba0e2d9de7ad41a9</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So <code>refs/notes/hg</code> points to a tree, which in the Git object database is a list of other objects with names.
<code>git ls-tree</code> outputs the mode, type, object hash, and filename for items inside a tree.
Once we dig down to one of the tree items, we find that inside it is a blob named “ac9117f” (the SHA-1 hash of the commit pointed to by <code>master</code>), with contents “0a04b98” (which is the ID of the Mercurial changeset at the tip of the <code>default</code> branch).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The good news is that we mostly don’t have to worry about all of this.
The typical workflow won’t be very different from working with a Git remote.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s one more thing we should attend to before we continue: ignores.
Mercurial and Git use a very similar mechanism for this, but it’s likely you don’t want to actually commit a <code>.gitignore</code> file into a Mercurial repository.
Fortunately, Git has a way to ignore files that’s local to an on-disk repository, and the Mercurial format is compatible with Git, so you just have to copy it over:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cp .hgignore .git/info/exclude</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file acts just like a <code>.gitignore</code>, but isn’t included in commits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_workflow">Workflow</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s assume we’ve done some work and made some commits on the <code>master</code> branch, and you’re ready to push it to the remote repository.
Here’s what our repository looks like right now:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our <code>master</code> branch is two commits ahead of <code>origin/master</code>, but those two commits exist only on our local machine.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since we used the <code>--all</code> flag, we see the “notes” refs that are used internally by git-remote-hg, but we can ignore them.
The rest is what we expected; <code>origin/master</code> has advanced by one commit, and our history has now diverged.

<h4 id="_branches_and_bookmarks">Branches and Bookmarks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git has only one kind of branch: a reference that moves when commits are made.
In Mercurial, this kind of a reference is called a “bookmark,” and it behaves in much the same way as a Git branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mercurial’s concept of a “branch” is more heavyweight.
The branch that a changeset is made on is recorded <em>with the changeset</em>, which means it will always be in the repository history.

<p>Note the line that begins with “branch”.
Git can’t really replicate this (and doesn’t need to; both types of branch can be represented as a Git ref), but git-remote-hg needs to understand the difference, because Mercurial cares.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating Mercurial bookmarks is as easy as creating Git branches.

<h3 id="_git_and_bazaar">Git and Bazaar</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the DVCS, another famous one is <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</a>.
Bazaar is free and open source, and is part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a>.
It behaves very differently from Git.
Sometimes, to do the same thing as with Git, you have to use a different keyword, and some keywords that are common don’t have the same meaning.
In particular, the branch management is very different and may cause confusion, especially when someone comes from Git’s universe.
Nevertheless, it is possible to work on a Bazaar repository from a Git one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many projects that allow you to use Git as a Bazaar client.
Here we’ll use Felipe Contreras' project that you may find at <a href="https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr" class="bare">https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr</a>.
To install it, you just have to download the file git-remote-bzr in a folder contained in your <code>$PATH</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ wget https://raw.github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr/master/git-remote-bzr -O ~/bin/git-remote-bzr
$ chmod +x ~/bin/git-remote-bzr</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also need to have Bazaar installed.
That’s all!</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_create_a_git_repository_from_a_bazaar_repository">Create a Git repository from a Bazaar repository</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is simple to use.
It is enough to clone a Bazaar repository prefixing it by <code>bzr::</code>.
Since Git and Bazaar both do full clones to your machine, it’s possible to attach a Git clone to your local Bazaar clone, but it isn’t recommended.
It’s much easier to attach your Git clone directly to the same place your Bazaar clone is attached to ‒ the central repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s suppose that you worked with a remote repository which is at address <code>bzr+ssh://developer@mybazaarserver:myproject</code>.
Then you must clone it in the following way:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone bzr::bzr+ssh://developer@mybazaarserver:myproject myProject-Git
$ cd myProject-Git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, your Git repository is created but it is not compacted for optimal disk use.
That’s why you should also clean and compact your Git repository, especially if it is a big one:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git gc --aggressive</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_bazaar_branches">Bazaar branches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bazaar only allows you to clone branches, but a repository may contain several branches, and <code>git-remote-bzr</code> can clone both.
For example, to clone a branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone bzr::bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/trunk emacs-trunk</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And to clone the whole repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone bzr::bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs emacs</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second command clones all the branches contained in the emacs repository; nevertheless, it is possible to point out some branches:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config remote-bzr.branches 'trunk, xwindow'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some remote repositories don’t allow you to list their branches, in which case you have to manually specify them, and even though you could specify the configuration in the cloning command, you may find this easier:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git init emacs
$ git remote add origin bzr::bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs
$ git config remote-bzr.branches 'trunk, xwindow'
$ git fetch</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_ignore_what_is_ignored_with_bzrignore">Ignore what is ignored with .bzrignore</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since you are working on a project managed with Bazaar, you shouldn’t create a <code>.gitignore</code> file because you <em>may</em> accidentally set it under version control and the other people working with Bazaar would be disturbed.
The solution is to create the <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file either as a symbolic link or as a regular file.
We’ll see later on how to solve this question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bazaar uses the same model as Git to ignore files, but also has two features which don’t have an equivalent into Git.
The complete description may be found in <a href="http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.2.7/en/user-reference/ignore-help.html">the documentation</a>.
The two features are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>"!!" allows you to ignore certain file patterns even if they’re specified using a "!" rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"RE:" at the beginning of a line allows you to specify a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">Python regular expression</a> (Git only allows shell globs).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a consequence, there are two different situations to consider:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If the <code>.bzrignore</code> file does not contain any of these two specific prefixes, then you can simply make a symbolic link to it in the repository: <code>ln -s .bzrignore .git/info/exclude</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, you must create the <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file and adapt it to ignore exactly the same files in <code>.bzrignore</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever the case is, you will have to remain vigilant against any change of <code>.bzrignore</code> to make sure that the <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file always reflects <code>.bzrignore</code>.
Indeed, if the <code>.bzrignore</code> file were to change and contained one or more lines starting with "!!" or "RE:", Git not being able to interpret these lines, you’ll have to adapt your <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file to ignore the same files as the ones ignored with <code>.bzrignore</code>.
Moreover, if the <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file was a symbolic link, you’ll have to first delete the symbolic link, copy <code>.bzrignore</code> to <code>.git/info/exclude</code> and then adapt the latter.
However, be careful with its creation because with Git it is impossible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_fetch_the_changes_of_the_remote_repository">Fetch the changes of the remote repository</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To fetch the changes of the remote, you pull changes as usually, using Git commands.
Supposing that your changes are on the <code>master</code> branch, you merge or rebase your work on the <code>origin/master</code> branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git pull --rebase origin</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_push_your_work_on_the_remote_repository">Push your work on the remote repository</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because Bazaar also has the concept of merge commits, there will be no problem if you push a merge commit.
So you can work on a branch, merge the changes into <code>master</code> and push your work.
Then, you create your branches, you test and commit your work as usual.
You finally push your work to the Bazaar repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git push origin master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_caveats">Caveats</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git’s remote-helpers framework has some limitations that apply.
In particular, these commands don’t work:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>git push origin :branch-to-delete (Bazaar can’t accept ref deletions in this way.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>git push origin old:new (it will push <em>old</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>git push --dry-run origin branch (it will push)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_summary_5">Summary</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Git’s and Bazaar’s models are similar, there isn’t a lot of resistance when working across the boundary.
As long as you watch out for the limitations, and are always aware that the remote repository isn’t natively Git, you’ll be fine.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_and_perforce">Git and Perforce</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

Perforce is a very popular version-control system in corporate environments.
It’s been around since 1995, which makes it the oldest system covered in this chapter.
As such, it’s designed with the constraints of its day; it assumes you’re always connected to a single central server, and only one version is kept on the local disk.
To be sure, its features and constraints are well-suited to several specific problems, but there are lots of projects using Perforce where Git would actually work better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two options if you’d like to mix your use of Perforce and Git.
The first one we’ll cover is the “Git Fusion” bridge from the makers of Perforce, which lets you expose subtrees of your Perforce depot as read-write Git repositories.
The second is git-p4, a client-side bridge that lets you use Git as a Perforce client, without requiring any reconfiguration of the Perforce server.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_p4_git_fusion">Git Fusion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Perforce provides a product called Git Fusion (available at <a href="http://www.perforce.com/git-fusion" class="bare">http://www.perforce.com/git-fusion</a>), which synchronizes a Perforce server with Git repositories on the server side.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_setting_up_2">Setting Up</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For our examples, we’ll be using the easiest installation method for Git Fusion, which is downloading a virtual machine that runs the Perforce daemon and Git Fusion.
You can get the virtual machine image from <a href="http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User" class="bare">http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User</a>, and once it’s finished downloading, import it into your favorite virtualization software (we’ll use VirtualBox).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon first starting the machine, it asks you to customize the password for three Linux users (<code>root</code>, <code>perforce</code>, and <code>git</code>), and provide an instance name, which can be used to distinguish this installation from others on the same network.
When that has all completed, you’ll see this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="{{< relurl "book/sv/v2/images/git-fusion-boot.png" >}}" alt="The Git Fusion virtual machine boot screen.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figur 146. The Git Fusion virtual machine boot screen.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should take note of the IP address that’s shown here, we’ll be using it later on.
Next, we’ll create a Perforce user.
Select the “Login” option at the bottom and press enter (or SSH to the machine), and log in as <code>root</code>.
Then use these commands to create a user:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ p4 -p localhost:1666 -u super user -f john
$ p4 -p localhost:1666 -u john passwd
$ exit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first one will open a VI editor to customize the user, but you can accept the defaults by typing <code>:wq</code> and hitting enter.
The second one will prompt you to enter a password twice.
That’s all we need to do with a shell prompt, so exit out of the session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next thing you’ll need to do to follow along is to tell Git not to verify SSL certificates.
The Git Fusion image comes with a certificate, but it’s for a domain that won’t match your virtual machine’s IP address, so Git will reject the HTTPS connection.
If this is going to be a permanent installation, consult the Perforce Git Fusion manual to install a different certificate; for our example purposes, this will suffice:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can test that everything is working.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone https://10.0.1.254/Talkhouse

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The virtual-machine image comes equipped with a sample project that you can clone.
Here we’re cloning over HTTPS, with the <code>john</code> user that we created above; Git asks for credentials for this connection, but the credential cache will allow us to skip this step for any subsequent requests.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_fusion_configuration">Fusion Configuration</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’ve got Git Fusion installed, you’ll want to tweak the configuration.
This is actually fairly easy to do using your favorite Perforce client; just map the <code>//.git-fusion</code> directory on the Perforce server into your workspace.
The file structure looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ tree

├── repos
│   └── Talkhouse
│       └── p4gf_config
└── users
    └── p4gf_usermap

498 directories, 287 files</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>objects</code> directory is used internally by Git Fusion to map Perforce objects to Git and vice versa, you won’t have to mess with anything in there.
There’s a global <code>p4gf_config</code> file in this directory, as well as one for each repository – these are the configuration files that determine how Git Fusion behaves.
Let’s take a look at the file in the root:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[repo-creation]
charset = utf8

[git-to-perforce]
change-owner = author
enable-git-branch-creation = yes
enable-swarm-reviews = yes
enable-git-merge-commits = yes
enable-git-submodules = yes
preflight-commit = none
ignore-author-permissions = no
read-permission-check = none
git-merge-avoidance-after-change-num = 12107

[perforce-to-git]
http-url = none
ssh-url = none

[@features]
imports = False
chunked-push = False
matrix2 = False
parallel-push = False

[authentication]
email-case-sensitivity = no</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We won’t go into the meanings of these flags here, but note that this is just an INI-formatted text file, much like Git uses for configuration.
This file specifies the global options, which can then be overridden by repository-specific configuration files, like <code>repos/Talkhouse/p4gf_config</code>.
If you open this file, you’ll see a <code>[@repo]</code> section with some settings that are different from the global defaults.
You’ll also see sections that look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[Talkhouse-master]
git-branch-name = master
view = //depot/Talkhouse/main-dev/... ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a mapping between a Perforce branch and a Git branch.
The section can be named whatever you like, so long as the name is unique.
<code>git-branch-name</code> lets you convert a depot path that would be cumbersome under Git to a more friendly name.
The <code>view</code> setting controls how Perforce files are mapped into the Git repository, using the standard view mapping syntax.
More than one mapping can be specified, like in this example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[multi-project-mapping]
git-branch-name = master
view = //depot/project1/main/... project1/...
       //depot/project2/mainline/... project2/...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way, if your normal workspace mapping includes changes in the structure of the directories, you can replicate that with a Git repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last file we’ll discuss is <code>users/p4gf_usermap</code>, which maps Perforce users to Git users, and which you may not even need.
When converting from a Perforce changeset to a Git commit, Git Fusion’s default behavior is to look up the Perforce user, and use the email address and full name stored there for the author/committer field in Git.
When converting the other way, the default is to look up the Perforce user with the email address stored in the Git commit’s author field, and submit the changeset as that user (with permissions applying).
In most cases, this behavior will do just fine, but consider the following mapping file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>john john@example.com "John Doe"
john johnny@appleseed.net "John Doe"
bob employeeX@example.com "Anon X. Mouse"
joe employeeY@example.com "Anon Y. Mouse"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each line is of the format <code>&lt;user&gt; &lt;email&gt; "&lt;full name&gt;"</code>, and creates a single user mapping.
The first two lines map two distinct email addresses to the same Perforce user account.
This is useful if you’ve created Git commits under several different email addresses (or change email addresses), but want them to be mapped to the same Perforce user.
When creating a Git commit from a Perforce changeset, the first line matching the Perforce user is used for Git authorship information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last two lines mask Bob and Joe’s actual names and email addresses from the Git commits that are created.
This is nice if you want to open-source an internal project, but don’t want to publish your employee directory to the entire world.
Note that the email addresses and full names should be unique, unless you want all the Git commits to be attributed to a single fictional author.</p>

<p>The first time you do this, it may take some time.
What’s happening is that Git Fusion is converting all the applicable changesets in the Perforce history into Git commits.
This happens locally on the server, so it’s relatively fast, but if you have a lot of history, it can still take some time.
Subsequent fetches do incremental conversion, so it’ll feel more like Git’s native speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, our repository looks exactly like any other Git repository you might work with.
There are three branches, and Git has helpfully created a local <code>master</code> branch that tracks <code>origin/master</code>.

You wouldn’t know it from this view, but the <code>6afeb15</code> commit was actually created using a Perforce client.

<p>Git thinks it worked.
Let’s take a look at the history of the <code>README</code> file from Perforce’s point of view, using the revision graph feature of <code>p4v</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="{{< relurl "book/sv/v2/images/git-fusion-perforce-graph.png" >}}" alt="Perforce revision graph resulting from Git push.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figur 147. Perforce revision graph resulting from Git push.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’ve never seen this view before, it may seem confusing, but it shows the same concepts as a graphical viewer for Git history.
We’re looking at the history of the <code>README</code> file, so the directory tree at top left only shows that file as it surfaces in various branches.
At top right, we have a visual graph of how different revisions of the file are related, and the big-picture view of this graph is at bottom right.
The rest of the view is given to the details view for the selected revision (<code>2</code> in this case).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing to notice is that the graph looks exactly like the one in Git’s history.
Perforce didn’t have a named branch to store the <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> commits, so it made an “anonymous” branch in the <code>.git-fusion</code> directory to hold it.
This will also happen for named Git branches that don’t correspond to a named Perforce branch (and you can later map them to a Perforce branch using the configuration file).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of this happens behind the scenes, but the end result is that one person on a team can be using Git, another can be using Perforce, and neither of them will know about the other’s choice.</p>

<h6 id="_git_fusion_summary">Git-Fusion Summary</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have (or can get) access to your Perforce server, Git Fusion is a great way to make Git and Perforce talk to each other.
There’s a bit of configuration involved, but the learning curve isn’t very steep.
This is one of the few sections in this chapter where cautions about using Git’s full power will not appear.
That’s not to say that Perforce will be happy with everything you throw at it – if you try to rewrite history that’s already been pushed, Git Fusion will reject it – but Git Fusion tries very hard to feel native.
You can even use Git submodules (though they’ll look strange to Perforce users), and merge branches (this will be recorded as an integration on the Perforce side).</p>

<p>If you can’t convince the administrator of your server to set up Git Fusion, there is still a way to use these tools together.</p>

Git-p4 is a two-way bridge between Git and Perforce.
It runs entirely inside your Git repository, so you won’t need any kind of access to the Perforce server (other than user credentials, of course).
Git-p4 isn’t as flexible or complete a solution as Git Fusion, but it does allow you to do most of what you’d want to do without being invasive to the server environment.</p>

<p>This creates what in Git terms is a “shallow” clone; only the very latest Perforce revision is imported into Git; remember, Perforce isn’t designed to give every revision to every user.

Git-p4 tries to honor your Git and Perforce settings individually when it has to provide a name for a commit or changeset, but in some cases you want to override it.

In this case, it looks like we’d be creating three Perforce changesets, which correspond to the three non-merge commits that don’t yet exist on the Perforce server.
That sounds like exactly what we want, let’s see how it turns out:</p>

<p>Our history became linear, just as though we had rebased before submitting (which is in fact exactly what happened).
This means you can be free to create, work on, throw away, and merge branches on the Git side without fear that your history will somehow become incompatible with Perforce.
If you can rebase it, you can contribute it to a Perforce server.</p>

<h6 id="_git_p4_branches">Branching</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your Perforce project has multiple branches, you’re not out of luck; git-p4 can handle that in a way that makes it feel like Git.
Let’s say your Perforce depot is laid out like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>//depot
  └── project
      ├── main
      └── dev</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And let’s say you have a <code>dev</code> branch, which has a view spec that looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>//depot/project/main/... //depot/project/dev/...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-p4 can automatically detect that situation and do the right thing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git p4 clone --detect-branches //depot/project@all

| * a43cfae Populate //depot/project/main/... //depot/project/dev/....
|/
* 2b83451 Project init</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the “@all” specifier in the depot path; that tells git-p4 to clone not just the latest changeset for that subtree, but all changesets that have ever touched those paths.
This is closer to Git’s concept of a clone, but if you’re working on a project with a long history, it could take a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>--detect-branches</code> flag tells git-p4 to use Perforce’s branch specs to map the branches to Git refs.
If these mappings aren’t present on the Perforce server (which is a perfectly valid way to use Perforce), you can tell git-p4 what the branch mappings are, and you get the same result:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git init project
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/project/.git/
$ cd project
$ git config git-p4.branchList main:dev
$ git clone --detect-branches //depot/project@all .</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setting the <code>git-p4.branchList</code> configuration variable to <code>main:dev</code> tells git-p4 that “main” and “dev” are both branches, and the second one is a child of the first one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we now <code>git checkout -b dev p4/project/dev</code> and make some commits, git-p4 is smart enough to target the right branch when we do <code>git p4 submit</code>.
Unfortunately, git-p4 can’t mix shallow clones and multiple branches; if you have a huge project and want to work on more than one branch, you’ll have to <code>git p4 clone</code> once for each branch you want to submit to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For creating or integrating branches, you’ll have to use a Perforce client.
Git-p4 can only sync and submit to existing branches, and it can only do it one linear changeset at a time.
If you merge two branches in Git and try to submit the new changeset, all that will be recorded is a bunch of file changes; the metadata about which branches are involved in the integration will be lost.</p>

However, it’s important to remember that Perforce is in charge of the source, and you’re only using Git to work locally.
Just be really careful about sharing Git commits; if you have a remote that other people use, don’t push any commits that haven’t already been submitted to the Perforce server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to freely mix the use of Perforce and Git as clients for source control, and you can convince the server administrator to install it, Git Fusion makes using Git a first-class version-control client for a Perforce server.</p>

<h3 id="_git_and_tfs">Git and TFS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

Git is becoming popular with Windows developers, and if you’re writing code on Windows, there’s a good chance you’re using Microsoft’s Team Foundation Server (TFS).
TFS is a collaboration suite that includes defect and work-item tracking, process support for Scrum and others, code review, and version control.
There’s a bit of confusion ahead: <strong>TFS</strong> is the server, which supports controlling source code using both Git and their own custom VCS, which they’ve dubbed <strong>TFVC</strong> (Team Foundation Version Control).
Git support is a somewhat new feature for TFS (shipping with the 2013 version), so all of the tools that predate that refer to the version-control portion as “TFS”, even though they’re mostly working with TFVC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you find yourself on a team that’s using TFVC but you’d rather use Git as your version-control client, there’s a project for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h4 id="_which_tool">Which Tool</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In fact, there are two: git-tf and git-tfs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-tfs (found at <a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs" class="bare">https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs</a>) is a .NET project, and (as of this writing) it only runs on Windows.
To work with Git repositories, it uses the .NET bindings for libgit2, a library-oriented implementation of Git which is highly performant and allows a lot of flexibility with the guts of a Git repository.
Libgit2 is not a complete implementation of Git, so to cover the difference git-tfs will actually call the command-line Git client for some operations, so there are no artificial limits on what it can do with Git repositories.
Its support of TFVC features is very mature, since it uses the Visual Studio assemblies for operations with servers.
This does mean you’ll need access to those assemblies, which means you need to install a recent version of Visual Studio (any edition since version 2010, including Express since version 2012), or the Visual Studio SDK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-tf (whose home is at <a href="https://gittf.codeplex.com" class="bare">https://gittf.codeplex.com</a>) is a Java project, and as such runs on any computer with a Java runtime environment.
It interfaces with Git repositories through JGit (a JVM implementation of Git), which means it has virtually no limitations in terms of Git functions.
However, its support for TFVC is limited as compared to git-tfs – it does not support branches, for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So each tool has pros and cons, and there are plenty of situations that favor one over the other.
We’ll cover the basic usage of both of them in this book.</p>

<h4 id="_getting_started_git_tf">Getting Started: <code>git-tf</code>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you do, just as with any Git project, is clone.
Here’s what that looks like with <code>git-tf</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git tf clone https://tfs.codeplex.com:443/tfs/TFS13 $/myproject/Main project_git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first argument is the URL of a TFVC collection, the second is of the form <code>$/project/branch</code>, and the third is the path to the local Git repository that is to be created (this last one is optional).
Git-tf can only work with one branch at a time; if you want to make checkins on a different TFVC branch, you’ll have to make a new clone from that branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This creates a fully functional Git repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd project_git

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is called a <em>shallow</em> clone, meaning that only the latest changeset has been downloaded.
TFVC isn’t designed for each client to have a full copy of the history, so git-tf defaults to only getting the latest version, which is much faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have some time, it’s probably worth it to clone the entire project history, using the <code>--deep</code> option:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the tags with names like <code>TFS_C35189</code>; this is a feature that helps you know which Git commits are associated with TFVC changesets.
This is a nice way to represent it, since you can see with a simple log command which of your commits is associated with a snapshot that also exists in TFVC.
They aren’t necessary (and in fact you can turn them off with <code>git config git-tf.tag false</code>) – git-tf keeps the real commit-changeset mappings in the <code>.git/git-tf</code> file.</p>

<p>Notice the <code>--with-branches</code> flag.
Git-tfs is capable of mapping TFVC branches to Git branches, and this flag tells it to set up a local Git branch for every TFVC branch.
This is highly recommended if you’ve ever branched or merged in TFS, but it won’t work with a server older than TFS 2010 – before that release, “branches” were just folders, so git-tfs can’t tell them from regular folders.</p>

    Hello

    git-tfs-id: [https://username.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection]$/myproject/Trunk;C16</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two local branches, <code>master</code> and <code>featureA</code>, which represent the initial starting point of the clone (<code>Trunk</code> in TFVC) and a child branch (<code>featureA</code> in TFVC).
You can also see that the <code>tfs</code> “remote” has a couple of refs too: <code>default</code> and <code>featureA</code>, which represent TFVC branches.
Git-tfs maps the branch you cloned from to <code>tfs/default</code>, and others get their own names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing to notice is the <code>git-tfs-id:</code> lines in the commit messages.
Instead of tags, git-tfs uses these markers to relate TFVC changesets to Git commits.
This has the implication that your Git commits will have a different SHA-1 hash before and after they have been pushed to TFVC.</p>

TFVC and TFS have several features that may add complexity to your workflow:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Feature branches that aren’t represented in TFVC add a bit of complexity.
This has to do with the <strong>very</strong> different ways that TFVC and Git represent branches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be aware that TFVC allows users to “checkout” files from the server, locking them so nobody else can edit them.
This obviously won’t stop you from editing them in your local repository, but it could get in the way when it comes time to push your changes up to the TFVC server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TFS has the concept of “gated” checkins, where a TFS build-test cycle has to complete successfully before the checkin is allowed.
This uses the “shelve” function in TFVC, which we don’t cover in detail here.
  You can fake this in a manual fashion with git-tf, and git-tfs provides the <code>checkintool</code> command which is gate-aware.</p>

<p>Looks like someone else is working, too, and now we have divergent history.
This is where Git shines, but we have two choices of how to proceed:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Making a merge commit feels natural as a Git user (after all, that’s what <code>git pull</code> does), and git-tf can do this for you with a simple <code>git tf pull</code>.
Be aware, however, that TFVC doesn’t think this way, and if you push merge commits your history will start to look different on both sides, which can be confusing.
However, if you plan on submitting all of your changes as one changeset, this is probably the easiest choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rebasing makes our commit history linear, which means we have the option of converting each of our Git commits into a TFVC changeset.
Since this leaves the most options open, we recommend you do it this way; git-tf even makes it easy for you with <code>git tf pull --rebase</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The choice is yours.

<p>Now we’re ready to make a checkin to the TFVC server.
Git-tf gives you the choice of making a single changeset that represents all the changes since the last one (<code>--shallow</code>, which is the default) and creating a new changeset for each Git commit (<code>--deep</code>).

Different git-tf clones of the same TFVC repository may have different commit SHA-1 hashes, which will cause no end of headaches.</p>

<p>Notice how after every successful checkin to the TFVC server, git-tfs is rebasing the remaining work onto what it just did.
That’s because it’s adding the <code>git-tfs-id</code> field to the bottom of the commit messages, which changes the SHA-1 hashes.
This is exactly as designed, and there’s nothing to worry about, but you should be aware that it’s happening, especially if you’re sharing Git commits with others.</p>

<p>TFS has many features that integrate with its version control system, such as work items, designated reviewers, gated checkins, and so on.

<p>Creating a branch in TFVC means adding a changeset where that branch now exists, and this is projected as a Git commit.
Note also that git-tfs <strong>created</strong> the <code>tfs/featureBee</code> remote branch, but <code>HEAD</code> is still pointing to <code>master</code>.
If you want to work on the newly-minted branch, you’ll want to base your new commits on the <code>1d54865</code> commit, perhaps by creating a topic branch from that commit.</p>

<h4 id="_git_and_tfs_summary">Git and TFS Summary</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-tf and Git-tfs are both great tools for interfacing with a TFVC server.
They allow you to use the power of Git locally, avoid constantly having to round-trip to the central TFVC server, and make your life as a developer much easier, without forcing your entire team to migrate to Git.
If you’re working on Windows (which is likely if your team is using TFS), you’ll probably want to use git-tfs, since its feature set is more complete, but if you’re working on another platform, you’ll be using git-tf, which is more limited.
As with most of the tools in this chapter, you should choose one of these version-control systems to be canonical, and use the other one in a subordinate fashion – either Git or TFVC should be the center of collaboration, but not both.</p>
