  <p>The content on this site is pulled from multiple sources. It is
  available under various licenses, and bugs reports should be directed
  to the appropriate repositories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Most of the "base" site content is hosted in the
      <a href="https://github.com/git/git-scm.com">git/git-scm.com</a>
      repository at GitHub. That includes all pages except the book and
      manpages, along with the general design of the site. This content
      is available under the
      <a href="https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt">MIT license</a>.
      Bug reports and suggestions may be made in that repository.
    </li>

    <li>Content from the ProGit book is imported from the
      <a href="https://github.com/progit/progit2">progit/progit2</a>
      repository, which is available under a Creative Commons
      <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a>
      license, <a href="https://github.com/progit/progit2/blob/master/LICENSE.asc">
        as specified in the progit2 repository</a>.
      Bug reports and suggestions may be made in the progit2 repository.
    </li>

    <li>The reference manual is imported from the Git project, and is
      available under the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/COPYING">GPL</a>.
      Bug reports and suggestions should be made to the upstream
      <a href="/community">Git community</a>.
    </li>

    <li>Bugs in the Git software itself should similarly go to the
      <a href="/community">Git community</a>.
