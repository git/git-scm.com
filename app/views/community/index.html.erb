  <h1> Community </h2>

  <h2> Mailing List </h2>

    The <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git">archive</a> can be found on Gmane.  Click <a href="mailto:majordomo@vger.kernel.org?body=subscribe git">here</a> to subscribe.

  <h2> Reporting Bugs </h2>
  
  Bug reports should be sent to the mailing list <a href="mailto:git@vger.kernel.org">git@vger.kernel.org</a>.

  <h2> IRC Channel </h2>

  <p>
    If the manpages and this book arenâ€™t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <span class="highlight fixed">#git</span> channel on the Freenode IRC server (<strong>irc.freenode.net</strong>). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.
  <p>

  <p>
    If you need specific help about one of the for-profit Git hosting sites, you might try their own IRC channels (such as <span class="highlight fixed">#github</span> or <span class="highlight fixed">#gitorious</span>) on the same IRC server.
  <p>

  <h2> Contributing to Git </h2>

  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation">Documentation directory</a> in the Git source code has several files of interest to developers who are looking to help contribute. After reading the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines">coding guidelines</a>, you can learn <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">how to submit patches</a>. For those looking to get more deeply involved, there is a <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt">howto for Git maintainers</a>.
