  <h2> Mailing List</h2>

  <p>
    Questions or comments for the Git community can be sent to the mailing list by using the email address <a href="mailto:git@vger.kernel.org">git@vger.kernel.org</a>. <strong>Bug reports for git should be sent to this mailing list.</strong>

    You do not need to subscribe: you will be Cc&apos;d in replies. Please keep the Cc list intact when replying (use &quot;Reply to all&quot;).

  <p>
    The <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git">archive</a> can be found on Gmane.  Click <a href="mailto:majordomo@vger.kernel.org?body=subscribe git">here</a> to subscribe. If you have trouble sending to the list with your regular mail reader, you may also <a href="http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.version-control.git">post via gmane</a>.

  <p>
    There is also <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/git-users">Git user mailing list</a> on Google Groups which is a nice place for beginners to ask about anything.
  </p>

  <h2> Bug Reporting </h2>

  <p>
    Bugs in git can be reported directly to the mailing list (see above for
    details). Note that you do not need to subscribe to the list to send
    to it. You can help us out by attempting to reproduce the bug in the latest
    released version of git, or if you're willing to build git from source, the
    <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/next"><code>next</code> branch</a>.
    Sometimes an attempted fix may be pending in this branch, in which case
    your feedback as to whether the fix worked for you will be appreciated.
  </p>

  <h2> IRC Channel </h2>

  <p>
    If the manpages and this book aren’t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <span class="highlight fixed">#git</span> channel on the Freenode IRC server (<strong>irc.freenode.net</strong>). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need specific help about one of the for-profit Git hosting sites, you might try their own IRC channels (such as <span class="highlight fixed">#github</span> or <span class="highlight fixed">#gitlab</span>) on the same IRC server.
  </p>

  <h2> Contributing to Git </h2>

  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation">Documentation directory</a> in the Git source code has several files of interest to developers who are looking to help contribute. After reading the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines">coding guidelines</a>, you can learn <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">how to submit patches</a>. For those looking to get more deeply involved, there is a <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt">howto for Git maintainers</a>.
