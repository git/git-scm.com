  <h2> Mailing List</h2>

  <p>
    Questions or comments for the Git community can be sent to the mailing list by using the email address <a href="mailto:git@vger.kernel.org">git@vger.kernel.org</a>. <strong>Bug reports should be sent to this mailing list.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    You do not need to subscribe: you will be Cc&apos;d in replies. Please keep the Cc list intact when replying (use &quot;Reply to all&quot;). Greylisting may delay your first post for a few hours.  Note also that the list only accepts plain-text email; please disable HTML in your outgoing messages.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git">archive</a> can be found on Gmane.  Click <a href="mailto:majordomo@vger.kernel.org?body=subscribe git">here</a> to subscribe. If you have trouble sending to the list with your regular mail reader, you may also <a href="http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.version-control.git">post via gmane</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is also <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/git-users">Git user mailing list</a> on Google Groups which is a nice place for beginners to ask about anything.
  </p>

  <h2> Bug Reporting </h2>

  <p>
    Bugs can be reported directly to the mailing list (see above for
    details). Note that you do not need to subscribe to the list to send
    to it.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are new to submitting bugs, you might find <a
      href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">this
      guide</a> helpful for producing useful bug reports.
  </p>

  <h2> IRC Channel </h2>

  <p>
    If the manpages and this book arenâ€™t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <span class="highlight fixed">#git</span> channel on the Freenode IRC server (<strong>irc.freenode.net</strong>). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need specific help about one of the for-profit Git hosting sites, you might try their own IRC channels (such as <span class="highlight fixed">#github</span> or <span class="highlight fixed">#gitlab</span>) on the same IRC server.
  </p>

  <h2> Contributing to Git </h2>

  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation">Documentation directory</a> in the Git source code has several files of interest to developers who are looking to help contribute. After reading the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines">coding guidelines</a>, you can learn <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">how to submit patches</a>. For those looking to get more deeply involved, there is a <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt">howto for Git maintainers</a>.
