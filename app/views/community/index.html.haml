  %h1 Community

  %h2 Mailing List

  %p
    Questions or comments for the Git community can be sent to the mailing list by using the email address <a href="mailto:git@vger.kernel.org">git@vger.kernel.org</a>. <strong>Bug reports should be sent to this mailing list.</strong> 
    
  %p
    The <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git">archive</a> can be found on Gmane.  Click <a href="mailto:majordomo@vger.kernel.org?body=subscribe git">here</a> to subscribe.  

  %p
    There is also <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/git-users">Git user mailing list</a> on Google Groups which is a nice place for beginners to ask about anything.

  %h2 IRC Channel

  %p
    If the manpages and this book arenâ€™t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <span class="highlight fixed">#git</span> channel on the Freenode IRC server (<strong>irc.freenode.net</strong>). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.

  %p
    If you need specific help about one of the for-profit Git hosting sites, you might try their own IRC channels (such as <span class="highlight fixed">#github</span> or <span class="highlight fixed">#gitorious</span>) on the same IRC server.

  %h2 Contributing to Git

  %p
    The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation">Documentation directory</a> in the Git source code has several files of interest to developers who are looking to help contribute. After reading the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines">coding guidelines</a>, you can learn <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">how to submit patches</a>. For those looking to get more deeply involved, there is a <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt">howto for Git maintainers</a>.
