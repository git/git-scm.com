  <h2>GIT TRADEMARK POLICY</h2>

  <h3>1 Purpose</h3>

  <p>The Git Project is a member project of Software Freedom
  Conservancy ("Conservancy"). Conservancy holds rights in the Marks
  on behalf of the Git Project in accordance with its non-
  profit charitable mission.</p>

  <p>Conservancy has adopted this Policy to protect the Marks (as
  defined below) and to make sure that the identity of Git software
  and its free and open source nature is clear to everyone. By
  using this Policy, the Git Project can spread the use of the
  Git software while making sure that the Marks are protected in a
  way that's consistent with U.S. trademark law (<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=4680534&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch">U.S. Registration 4680534</a>).  This Policy is
  written to allow all clear and appropriate use of the Marks while
  disapproving use of the Marks in ways that could confuse users as
  to where the software came from, or that implies an otherwise non-
  existent association with the Git Project. By adhering to this
  Policy, you help to promote to the public the freedom to use and
  develop the Git software.</p>

  <p>Throughout this Policy, the word "Marks" refers to the following:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>the literal mark "Git"</p></li>
  <li><p>The logos and graphic marks displayed and available for
  download at <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/logos">https://git-scm.com/downloads/logos</a></p></li>
  <li><p>The slogan "the stupid content tracker"</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This Policy is only concerned with the Marks associated with the Git
  Project, and does not address any copyrights associated with the
  Git software.</p>

  <h3>2 Guidelines for using the Marks</h3>

  <h4>2.1 Trademark symbol on first mention</h4>

  <p>The first prominent mention of a Mark should be immediately
  followed by a symbol for, as applicable, a registered trademark
  (®) or an unregistered trademark (™). For example: "Git™".</p>

  <p>This requirement is waived in all contexts where such marks are
  not required to protect the intellectual property rights associated
  with the Marks, such as email, online discussion, and academic papers.
  We encourage the use of the applicable symbols whenever possible, but
  recognize that many users will omit them in non-commercial and informal
  contexts.</p>

  <p>You can use "Git and the Git logo are either registered trademarks
  or trademarks of Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc., corporate home of
  the Git Project, in the United States and/or other countries." when
  you need to mention "Git" in e.g. list of trademarks held by other
  people.</p>

  <h4>2.2 Use of the Marks without written permission</h4>

  <p>You may use the Marks without prior written permission (subject
  to the other sections):</p>

  <ol>
  <li><p>To refer to the Git software in substantially unmodified
  form. "Substantially unmodified" means built from the source
  code provided by the Git Project, possibly with minor
  modifications including but not limited to: the enabling or
  disabling of certain features by default, translations into
  other languages, changes required for compatibility with a
  particular operating system distribution, or the inclusion of
  bug-fix patches.</p></li>
  <li><p>To identify the Git software as a distinct component of a
  software offering.</p></li>
  <li><p>To factually refer to the Git Project itself, its products,
  or its protocols.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>In addition, you may use the Marks to refer to products,
  services, or communities outside of the Git software and Git
  Project without written permission in the following contexts:</p>

  <ol start="4">
  <li>When referring to Git software that is not substantially
  unmodified, to say that such software is a "derivative of"
  or "based on" Git.</li>
  <li>When referring to a third-party software product and/or service that
  is interoperable with the Git software, in the format "[Product Name]
  for Git" -- provided that such use otherwise complies with the rest of
  this Policy.
  </ol>

  <p>We do not charge a fee for a license to use the Marks
  in these contexts. However, we do of course welcome donations.
  If you're interested in donating to the Git Project, care of
  Conservancy, visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/sfc">https://git-scm.com/sfc</a>.
  Conservancy is a United States 501(c)(3) public charity.</p>

  <h4>2.3 Prohibited usages of the Marks</h4>

  <p>You may not use the Marks in the following ways:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>In any way likely to cause confusion as to the identity of the
  Git Project, the provenance of its software, or the
  software's license.</p></li>
  <li><p>In any way that indicates a greater degree of association
  between you and the Git Project than actually exists.</p></li>
  <li><p>In any way that implies a designated successor to Git (e.g.,
  "Git++" is not permitted).</p></li>
  <li><p>In any way that indicates that Git favors one distribution,
  platform, product, etc. over another except where explicitly
  indicated in writing by Conservancy.</p></li>
  <li><p>In any other way that dilutes or otherwise infringes upon the
  trademark rights of Conservancy and the Git Project in the
  Marks.</p></li>
  <li><p>To refer to the Git software, modified by a third party to the point of
  inoperability with Git software in substantially unmodified form.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition, you may not use any of the Marks as a syllable in a new word
  or as part of a portmanteau (e.g., "Gitalicious", "Gitpedia") used as a
  mark for a third-party product or service without Conservancy's written
  permission.  For the avoidance of doubt, this provision applies even to
  third-party marks that use the Marks as a syllable or as part of a
  portmanteau to refer to a product or service's use of Git code.</p>

  <h4>2.4 Limitations to this Policy</h4>

  <p>This Policy does not confer any rights to use the trademarks
  "Software Freedom Conservancy," "Conservancy," or to use any other
  trademarks other than the Marks listed in Section 1. This Policy
  does not authorize you to act as an agent for Conservancy, enter
  into any agreement on behalf of or otherwise create any
  liability for the Git Project or Conservancy.</p>

  <h4>2.5 Use of the Marks in merchandising</h4>

  <p>You may not create and/or sell merchandise bearing any of the Marks
  without Conservancy's express written permission.  If you are interested
  in using creating and/or selling merchandise bearing any of the the Marks,
  please send proofs of your designs to us at
  <a href="mailto:trademark@sfconservancy.org">TRADEMARK@SFCONSERVANCY.ORG</a>.
  </p>

  whatsoever, other clauses notwithstanding.</p></li>
