    <h2>Data Assurance</h2>
    <p>
    The data model that Git uses ensures the cryptographic integrity of every bit
    of your project.  Every file and commit is checksummed and retrieved by its
    checksum when checked back out. It's impossible to get anything out of Git
    other than the <strong>exact bits you put in</strong>.

    <p>
    It is also impossible to change any file, date, commit message, or any other
    data in a Git repository without changing the IDs of everything after it.
    This means that if you have a commit ID, you can be assured not only that
    your project is exactly the same as when it was committed, but
    that nothing in its history was changed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most centralized version control systems provide no such integrity by default.
