title: Kindle Version Available

When Pro Git was first released, I asked about being able to get it on my Kindle.  In fact, one of the very first people to read the book was <a href="http://twitter.com/adelcambre">@adelcambre</a> with a mobi file I generated myself.  It was horrible looking, because I didn't do it very well, but it did work. My editor at Apress wanted to get a professional Kindle version produced, but wasn't sure if it was going to get done anytime soon. 

Well, I just randomly found out that it did in fact finally get done.  About 9 months after it was first published, I saw on my Amazon referal account that I had sold a Kindle version, which confused me.  However, I went to Amazon and there it was:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NHRMXA?ie=UTF8&tag=prgi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003NHRMXA"><img border="0" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51joD88JCAL._SL500_AA266_PIkin2,BottomRight,-3,34_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=prgi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003NHRMXA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I assume it looks much, much better than the version I originally did for Andy.  (I should probably get myself a copy).  So, if you feel like reading it on the Kindle, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NHRMXA?ie=UTF8&tag=prgi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003NHRMXA">have at it</a>.  There have also been a number of people who have asked me how they can support the book without getting a dead-tree version, so here's your chance.  You can even get a Kindle reader for your computer, so you can search through it and whatnot.  Enjoy!
