title: Pro Git on your iPad
---

The awesome guys at <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a> have converted
the Pro Git book into ePub format that looks great on the iBook reader on the iPad.

You can download it 
<a href="https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/media/progit.epub">here</a>
and just drop the ePub file onto iTunes to upload it into your iPad.  For reading
Pro Git on the road, this is a great format and MT did an amazing job at making it
look good on that platform.

Check it out - here is Pro Git in your bookshelf:

Sweet - thanks guys!

*Update:* I've added a Stanza Atom catalog feed for those of you who want to load
the epub book onto your Android running <a href="http://www.aldiko.com/">Aldiko</a>
or iPhone running <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a>. To download the 
book, simply add a custom catalog with this URL:
