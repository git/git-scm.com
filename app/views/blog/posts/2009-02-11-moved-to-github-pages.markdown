title: Welcome to the Pro Git website
---

This is the first post on the Pro Git book website, which contains the
full content of the book published by Apress and a blog for me to share
Git tips and book news with everybody.

I'm incredibly excited to get this book published - it has been a really
long time in the making, and I'm glad Apress let me publish the content
under a Creative Commons license, so I can share it online as well.  If you 
find the content helpful, please support this kind of open documentation
by buying a print version of the book at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430218339?ie=UTF8&tag=prgi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430218339">Amazon</a>.

The print version of the book is going to the presses soon and should be 
shipping around the end of August.  I was first contacted by Apress at the
very end of November of last year and had my first draft of the first chapter
in on December 15.  Since then, it has been a whirlwind of writing, reviewing,
rewriting and re-reviewing of 9 long chapters.  That's about 8 months from
start to finish and has been one of the most monumental side-projects I've
ever done.  I've learned a ton about the publishing and book-writing process
and also about Git.

I hope you enjoy the book and I hope that it helps you to learn one of the 
most amazing tools you can add to your development arsenal.
