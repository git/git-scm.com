title: Reset Demystified
---

<p>One of the topics that I didn't cover in depth in the Pro Git book is the
<code>reset</code> command.  Most of the reason for this, honestly, is that
I never strongly understood the command beyond the handful of
specific use cases that I needed it for.  I knew what the command did, but
not really how it was designed to work.</p>

<p>Since then I have become more comfortable with the command, largely thanks to
<a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/git-reset.html">Mark Dominus's article</a>
re-phrasing the content of the man-page, which I always found very difficult to
follow. After reading that explanation of the command, I now personally feel
more comfortable using <code>reset</code> and enjoy trying to help others feel
the same way.</p>

<p>This post assumes some basic understanding of how Git branching works. If you
don't really know what HEAD and the Index are on a basic level, you might want to
read chapters 2 and 3 of this book before reading this post.</p>

<h2>The Three Trees of Git</h2>

<img src="/images/reset/trees.png"/><br/>

<p>The way I now like to think about <code>reset</code> and <code>checkout</code>
is through the mental frame of Git being a content manager of three different
trees. By 'tree' here I really mean "collection of files", not specifically the
data structure. (Some Git developers will get a bit mad at me here, because there
are a few cases where the Index doesn't exactly act like a tree, but for our purposes
it is easier - forgive me).</p>

<p>Git as a system manages and manipulates three trees in its
normal operation. Each of these is covered in the book, but let's review them.</p>


<table id="threetrees">
  <tr>
    <th class="title" colspan="2">Tree Roles</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>The HEAD</th><td>last commit snapshot, next parent</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>The Index</th><td>proposed next commit snapshot</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>The Working Directory</th><td>sandbox</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3 class="subtitle">
  The HEAD
  <small>last commit snapshot, next parent</small>
</h3>

<p>
The HEAD in Git is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in
turn a pointer to the last commit you made or the last commit that was checked
out into your working directory.  That also means it will be the parent of the
next commit you do. It's generally simplest to think of it as <b>HEAD is the
snapshot of your last commit</b>.
</p>

<p>In fact, it's pretty easy to see what the snapshot of your HEAD looks like.
Here is an example of getting the actual directory listing and SHA checksums
for each file in the HEAD snapshot:</p>

<pre>
$ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/master

$ cat .git/refs/heads/master 
e9a570524b63d2a2b3a7c3325acf5b89bbeb131e

$ git cat-file -p e9a570524b63d2a2b3a7c3325acf5b89bbeb131e

</pre>

<h3 class="subtitle">
  The Index
  <small>next proposed commit snapshot</small>
</h3>

<p>
The Index is your proposed next commit.  Git populates it with a list of all the
file contents that were last checked out into your working directory and what
they looked like when they were originally checked out.  It's not technically a
tree structure, it's a flattened manifest, but for our purposes it's close
enough. When you run <code>git commit</code>, that command only looks at your
Index by default, not at anything in your working directory.  So, it's simplest
to think of it as <b>the Index is the snapshot of your next commit</b>.
</p>

<pre>
$ git ls-files -s
100644 a906cb2a4a904a152e80877d4088654daad0c859 0	README

</pre>

<h3 class="subtitle">
  The Working Directory
  <small>sandbox, scratch area</small>
</h3>

<p>
Finally, you have your working directory.  This is where the content of files
are placed into actual files on your filesystem so they're easily edited by
you. <b>The Working Directory is your scratch space, used to easily modify file
content.</b>

<h2>The Workflow</h2>

<p>So, Git is all about recording snapshots of your project in successively
better states by manipulating these three trees, or collections of contents
of files.</p>

<center><img width="400px" src="/images/reset/workflow.png"/></center><br/>

<p>Let's visualize this process.  Say you go into a new directory with a single
file in it. We'll call this V1 of the file and we'll indicate it in blue.
Now we run <code>git init</code>, which will create a Git repository with a
HEAD reference that points to an unborn branch (aka, <i>nothing</i>)</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/ex2.png"/></center><br/>

<p>At this point, only the <b>Working Directory</b> tree has any content.</p>

<p>Now we want to commit this file, so we use <code>git add</code> to take
content in your Working Directory and populate our Index with the updated
content</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/ex3.png"/></center><br/>

<p>Then we run <code>git commit</code> to take what the Index looks like now
and save it as a permanent snapshot pointed to by a commit, which HEAD is then
updated to point at.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/ex4.png"/></center><br/>

<p>At this point, all three of the trees are the same.  If we run
<code>git status</code> now, we'll see no changes because they're all the
same.</p>

<p>Now we want to make a change to that file and commit it.  We will go
through the same process. First we change the file in our working directory.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/ex5.png"/></center><br/>

<p>If we run <code>git status</code> right now we'll see the file in red as
"changed but not updated" because that entry differs between our Index and our
Working Directory. Next we run <code>git add</code> on it to stage it into our
Index.<p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/ex6.png"/></center><br/>

<p>At this point if we run <code>git status</code> we will see the file in green
under 'Changes to be Committed' because the Index and HEAD differ - that is, our
proposed next commit is now different from our last commit.  Those are the entries
we will see as 'to be Committed'. Finally, we run <code>git commit</code> to
finalize the commit.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/ex7.png"/></center><br/>

<p>Now <code>git status</code> will give us no output because all three trees
are the same.</p>

<p>Switching branches or cloning goes through a similar process.
When you checkout a branch, it changes <b>HEAD</b> to point to the new commit,
populates your <b>Index</b> with the snapshot of that commit, then checks out the
contents of the files in your <b>Index</b> into your <b>Working Directory</b>.</p>


<h2>The Role of Reset</h2>

<p>So the <code>reset</code> command makes more sense when viewed in this
context.  It directly manipulates these three trees in a simple and predictable
way.  It does up to three basic operations.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">
  Step 1: Moving HEAD
  <small>killing me --soft ly</small>
</h3>

<p>
The first thing <code>reset</code> will do is move what HEAD points to.  Unlike
<code>checkout</code> it does not move what branch HEAD points to, it directly
changes the SHA of the reference itself.  This means if HEAD is pointing to the
'master' branch, running <code>git reset 9e5e64a</code> will first of all make
'master' point to <code>9e5e64a</code> before it does anything else.
</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/reset-soft.png"/></center><br/>

<p>No matter what form of <code>reset</code> with a commit you invoke, this is
the first thing it will always try to do. If you add the flag <code>--soft</code>,
this is the <b>only</b> thing it will do. With <code>--soft</code>, <code>reset</code>
will simply stop there.</p>

<p>Now take a second to look at that diagram and realize what it did.  It
essentially undid the last commit you made.  When you run <code>git commit</code>,
Git will create a new commit and move the branch that <code>HEAD</code> points
to up to it.  When you <code>reset</code> back to <code>HEAD~</code> (the parent
of HEAD), you are moving the branch back to where it was without changing the Index
(staging area) or Working Directory.  You could now do a bit more work and
<code>commit</code> again to accomplish basically what <code>git commit --amend</code>
would have done.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">
  Step 2: Updating the Index
  <small>having --mixed feelings</small>
</h3>

<p>Note that if you run <code>git status</code> now you'll see in green the
difference between the Index and what the new HEAD is.</p>

<p>The next thing <code>reset</code> will do 
is to update the Index with the contents of whatever tree HEAD now
points to so they're the same.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/reset-mixed.png"/></center><br/>

<p>If you specify the <code>--mixed</code> option, <code>reset</code> will stop
at this point.  This is also the default, so if you specify no option at all,
this is where the command will stop.</p>

<p>Now take another second to look at THAT diagram and realize what it did. It
still undid your last <code>commit</code>, but also <i>unstaged</i> everything.
You rolled back to before you ran all your <code>git add</code>s <i>AND</i>
<code>git commit</code>.
</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">
  Step 3: Updating the Working Directory
  <small>math is --hard, let's go shopping</small>
</h3>

<p>The third thing that <code>reset</code> will do is to then make the Working
Directory look like the Index.  If you use the <code>--hard</code> option, it
will continue to this stage.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/reset-hard.png"/></center><br/>

<p>Finally, take yet a third second to look at <i>that</i> diagram and think
about what happened.  You undid your last commit, all the <code>git add</code>s,
<i>and</i> all the work you did in your working directory.</p>

<p>It's important to note at this point that this is the only way to make the
<code>reset</code> command dangerous (ie: not working directory safe).  Any
other invocation of <code>reset</code> can be pretty easily undone, the
<code>--hard</code> option cannot, since it overwrites (without checking) any
files in the Working Directory. In this particular case, we still have <b>v3</b>
version of our file in a commit in our Git DB that we could get back by looking
at our <code>reflog</code>, but if we had not committed it, Git still would have
overwritten the file.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
That is basically it.  The <code>reset</code> command overwrites these three
trees in a specific order, stopping when you tell it to.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>#1) Move whatever branch HEAD points to <small>(stop if <code>--soft</code>)</small>
  <li>#2) THEN, make the Index look like that <small>(stop here unless <code>--hard</code>)</small>
  <li>#3) THEN, make the Working Directory look like that
</ul>

<p>There are also <code>--merge</code> and <code>--keep</code> options, but
I would rather keep things simpler for now - that will be for another article.</p>

<p>Boom. You are now a <code>reset</code> master.</p>

<h2>Reset with a Path</h2>

<p>
Well, I lied.  That's not actually all.  If you specify a path,
<code>reset</code> will skip the first step and just do the other ones but limited
to a specific file or set of files.  This actually sort of makes sense - if the
first step is to move a pointer to a different commit, you can't make it point
to <i>part</i> of a commit, so it simply doesn't do that part.  However, you can
use <code>reset</code> to update part of the Index or the Working Directory
with previously committed content this way.
</p>

<p>So, assume we run <code>git reset file.txt</code>.  This assumes, since you
did not specify a commit SHA or branch that points to a commit SHA, and that you
provided no reset option, that you are typing the shorthand for 
<code>git reset --mixed HEAD file.txt</code>, which will:

<ul>
  <li><strike>#1) Move whatever branch HEAD points to <small>(stop if <code>--soft</code>)</strike></small>
  <li>#2) THEN, make the Index look like that <small><strike>(stop here unless <code>--hard</code>)</strike></small>
</ul>

<p>So it essentially just takes whatever <code>file.txt</code> looks like in
HEAD and puts that in the Index.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/reset-path1.png"/></center><br/>

<p>So what does that do in a practical sense?  Well, it <i>unstages</i> the
file.  If we look at the diagram for that command vs what <code>git add</code>
does, we can see that it is simply the opposite.  This is why the output of
the <code>git status</code> command suggests that you run this to unstage a
file.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/reset-path2.png"/></center><br/>

<p>We could just as easily not let Git assume we meant "pull the data from HEAD"
by specifying a specific commit to pull that file version from to populate our
Index by running something like <code>git reset eb43bf file.txt</code>.

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/reset-path3.png"/></center><br/>

<p>So what does that mean?  That functionally does the same thing as if we had
reverted the content of the file to <b>v1</b>, ran <code>git add</code> on it,
then reverted it back to to <b>v3</b> again.  If we run <code>git commit</code>,
it will record a change that reverts that file back to <b>v1</b>, even though
we never actually had it in our Working Directory again.</p>

<p>It's also pretty interesting to note that like <code>git add --patch</code>,
the <code>reset</code> command will accept a <code>--patch</code> option to
unstage content on a hunk-by-hunk basis.  So you can selectively unstage or
revert content.</p>

<h2>A fun example</h2>

<p>I may use the term "fun" here a bit loosely, but if this doesn't sound like
fun to you, you may drink while doing it.  Let's look at how to do something
interesting with this newfound power - squashing commits.</p>

<p>If you have this history and you're about to push and you want to squash
down the last N commits you've done into one awesome commit that makes you
look really smart (vs a bunch of commits with messages like "oops.", "WIP"
and "forgot this file") you can use <code>reset</code> to quickly and easily
do that (as opposed to using <code>git rebase -i</code>).</p>

<p>So, let's take a slightly more complex example.  Let's say you have a project
where the first commit has one file, the second commit added a new file and changed
the first, and the third commit changed the first file again. The second commit
was a work in progress and you want to squash it down.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/squash-r1.png"/></center><br/>

<p>You can run <code>git reset --soft HEAD~2</code> to move the HEAD
branch back to an older commit (the first commit you want to keep):</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/squash-r2.png"/></center><br/>

<p>And then simply run <code>git commit</code> again:</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/squash-r3.png"/></center><br/>

<p>
Now you can see that your reachable history, the history you would push,
now looks like you had one commit with the one file, then a second that both
added the new file and modified the first to it's final state.
</p>

<h2>Check it out</h2>

<p>Finally, some of you may wonder what the difference between <code>checkout</code>
and <code>reset</code> is. Well, like <code>reset</code>, <code>checkout</code>
manipulates the three trees and it is a bit different depending on whether you
give the command a file path or not.  So, let's look at both examples seperately.
</p>

<h3>git checkout [branch]</h3>

<p>Running <code>git checkout [branch]</code> is pretty similar to running
<code>git reset --hard [branch]</code> in that it updates all three trees for
you to look like <code>[branch]</code>, but there are two important differences.
</p>

<p>First, unlike <code>reset --hard</code>, <code>checkout</code> is working
directory safe in this invocation.  It will check to make sure it's not blowing
away files that have changes to them.  Actually, this is a subtle difference,
because it will update all of the working directory except the files you've
modified if it can - it will do a trivial merge between what you're checking
out and what's already there.  In this case, <code>reset --hard</code> will
simply replace everything across the board without checking.
</p>

<p>The second important difference is how it updates HEAD.  Where <code>reset</code>
will move the branch that HEAD points to, <code>checkout</code> will move HEAD
itself to point to another branch.</p>

<p>For instance, if we have two branches, 'master'
and 'develop' pointing at different commits, and we're currently on 'develop'
(so HEAD points to it) and we run <code>git reset master</code>, 'develop' itself
will now point to the same commit that 'master' does.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we instead run <code>git checkout master</code>, 'develop'
will not move, HEAD itself will.  HEAD will now point to 'master'.  So, in both
cases we're moving HEAD to point to commit A, but <i>how</i> we do so is very
different.  <code>reset</code> will move the branch HEAD points to,
<code>checkout</code> moves HEAD itself to point to another branch.</p>

<center><img width="500px" src="/images/reset/reset-checkout.png"/></center><br/>

<h3>git checkout [branch] file</h3>

<p>The other way to run <code>checkout</code> is with a file path, which like
<code>reset</code>, does not move HEAD.  It is just like <code>git reset [branch] file</code>
in that it updates the index with that file at that commit, but it also
overwrites the file in the working directory.  Think of it like
<code>git reset --hard [branch] file</code> - it would be exactly the same thing,
it is also not working directory safe and it also does not move HEAD.  The only
difference is that <code>reset</code> with a file name will not accept <code>--hard</code>,
so you can't actually run that.</p>

<p>Also, like <code>git reset</code> and <code>git add</code>, <code>checkout</code>
will accept a <code>--patch</code> option to allow you to selectively revert file
contents on a hunk-by-hunk basis.</p>

<h2>Cheaters Gonna Cheat</h2>

<p>Hopefully now you understand and feel more comfortable with the
<code>reset</code> command, but are probably still a little confused about how
exactly it differs from <code>checkout</code> and could not possibly remember
all the rules of the different invocations.</p>

<p>So to help you out, I've created something that I pretty much hate, which
is a table. However, if you've followed the article at all, it may be a useful
cheat sheet or reminder. The table shows each class of the <code>reset</code>
and <code>checkout</code> commands and which of the three trees it updates.</p>

<p>Pay especial attention to the 'WD Safe?' column - if
it's red, really think about it before you run that command.</p>

<table class="rdata">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>head</th>
    <th>index</th>
    <th>work dir</th>
    <th>wd safe</th>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr class="level">

    <td colspan="4">&nbsp;</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <th class="cmd">reset (commit) [file]</th>
    <td class="no">NO</td>
    <td class="yes">YES</td>
    <td class="no">NO</td>

    <td class="no">NO</td>
    <td class="yes">YES</td>
    <td class="yes">YES</td>
    <td class="no-wd">NO</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Good night, and good luck.</p>
