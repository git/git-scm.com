title: Pro Git 简体中文版
---

The amazing <a href="http://chunzi.me/">Chunzi</a>, in addition to translating 
and helping to coordinate the translation of the Chinese version of Pro Git, 
has just sent me a draft epub of the book in Chinese.

As he says:

"下载地址：http://cl.ly/da7a450319adfac01108

此书基本完成翻译，但仍有大半尚未审阅。今心血来潮，做了 epub 版本，可在 iPad 上阅读。生成代码在 http://github.com/chunzi/progit/tree/master/epub-zh。

既然是开源图书，所以优先级比较低。后续更新时再作新版。"

I have also uploaded the file to S3 in addition to his cl.ly link.  If you want
Pro Git in Chinese on your iPad, you can download it
<a href="https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/media/progit-zh.epub">here</a>.

祝你好运！
